//! THE OWNED-ROOT CONFINEMENT PROPERTY, re-established against this crate's
//! own primitives.
//!
//! The store's `_fd` family resolves every path COMPONENT-WISE relative to
//! the owned root's open directory descriptor with `openat(O_NOFOLLOW)`. A
//! symlink injected into a path component must therefore never redirect a
//! mutation or a read outside the owned root: the operation is refused by the
//! component-wise open (the error names `openat`/`open`, never a byte from the
//! outside target), and the outside target is left byte-for-byte untouched.
//!
//! This is the crate-level re-establishment of the two tests the source crate
//! carried in `src/store/local/owned_root.rs`
//! (`symlink_injected_path_component_cannot_redirect_a_mutation` /
//! `..._a_read`), which drove the property through application types
//! (`LocalStore`/`TargetName`/`retention_debt`) that do not exist here.
