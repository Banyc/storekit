//! The COMPOSED destination-ownership form: a run that holds BOTH the
//! destination's sibling operation-lock record
//! ([`storekit::sync::destination_lock_path`]) and the caller's in-root
//! `Layout::lock`.
//!
//! The sibling record and the in-root layout lock are DIFFERENT files, so on
//! their own they do NOT exclude each other. `DestinationOwnership::lock` is
//! unchanged and takes the sibling record alone; a caller that needs both
//! records held asks for it by name with
//! `DestinationOwnership::lock_with_in_root_lock`, which acquires the sibling
//! record and then the caller's in-root record — the ONE canonical order,
//! enforced in the constructor.
//!
//! These tests run against the PUBLIC API only. They pin, on BOTH directions
//! (PUSH and PULL):
//!
//! * the composed token HOLDS both records (a bare `FileLock` on either is
//!   refused while it is alive), and two composed runs, a composed run and a
//!   plain run, exclude each other;
//! * the canonical order is sibling-first (a composed acquisition whose
//!   sibling record is contended does not create the in-root record);
//! * taking the two records in OPPOSITE orders does not deadlock, because both
//!   acquisitions are non-blocking;
//! * the composed form requires the destination root to already exist (a typed
//!   `Error::NotFound`), and creates nothing when it refuses;
//! * the in-root record is destination RESIDUE: it is stripped from the view
//!   the run judges, reported in `residue` (never `extraneous`), and never
//!   destroyed;
//! * the PLAIN form is unchanged: it never creates or holds the in-root record.

// Test fixtures drive the same name-creating primitives the funnel guards.
