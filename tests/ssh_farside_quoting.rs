//! Far-side shell-quoting contract for `SshTransport`.
//!
//! THE HARNESS — an `ssh` SHIM ON `PATH`. The harness uses a shim rather than a
//! real `ssh`/`sshd` so the far side is HERMETIC and byte-exact, so the transport is pointed (through the
//! hermetic [`SysEnv`] snapshot every child receives) at a shim `ssh` that
//! takes the remote command string the transport constructed — the FINAL
//! argument, `bash -c '<script>'` — and runs it in a designated working
//! directory:
//!
//! ```sh
//! last=''; for arg in "$@"; do last=$arg; done
//! cd "$STOREKIT_SSH_SHIM_WORK" && exec /bin/sh -c "$last"
//! ```
//!
//! WHAT THE SHIM PROVES. The exact command string `SshTransport` builds is
//! re-parsed by a REAL POSIX shell (`/bin/sh -c` parses the `bash -c '...'`
//! invocation; the inner `bash -c` then parses the far-side script), in a real
//! working directory, against a real filesystem. Word splitting, pathname
//! expansion, option parsing, quoting, and the stdin payload all behave as
//! they would far side, and an object created relative to the working
//! directory is a genuine object OUTSIDE the destination root. The macOS run
//! exercises a BSD userland (`stat`, `ln`, `mkdir`, ...); the Linux run
//! exercises GNU coreutils.
//!
//! WHAT THE SHIM DOES NOT PROVE. It does not talk to any network and does not
//! exercise the SSH protocol or a real remote login shell: no connection
//! handshake, no encryption, no `sshd`, no `ConnectionMultiplexing`/`ControlMaster`,
//! no OpenSSH option parsing (`--`/`-p`/`-o`), no remote login-shell startup
//! files, and no remote filesystem semantics (NFS/overlayfs/...) — the far
//! side is the SAME host and the SAME local filesystem. A defect that depends
//! on any of those is out of scope here and is NOT covered by these tests.
//!
//! The tests drive [`Remote::write`] and [`Remote::symlink`] directly. The
//! sync applier slice that normally calls them is not ported into this crate
//! yet (`src/sync.rs` is a stub), so the "run is `Ok` / `applied` is right"
//! assertions are expressed as `Remote::write` returning `Ok`, the literal
//! destination path round-tripping its exact bytes and mode, and the
//! destination root holding exactly the planned entries.
