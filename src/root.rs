//! The SEALED filesystem-ownership root ([`OwnedRoot`]): the canonical,
//! non-root, non-symlink directory a store owns, registered per resolved
//! endpoint so two owners can never overlap.
//!
//! Filesystem ownership is LEXICAL today: two stores (or two deployment
//! roots) can be created on the same directory, or on ancestor/descendant
//! directories of each other, and nothing rejects it — two owners over
//! overlapping state. The [`OwnedRoot`] closes that class:
//!
//! * **Sealed** — the fields are private and there is NO unchecked
//!   constructor; the ONLY construction path is [`OwnedRoot::parse`], which
//!   canonicalizes the path, rejects the filesystem root, and rejects a
//!   symlink root (the root must be a REAL directory, not a symlink).
//! * **Overlap refusal** — two [`OwnedRoot`]s on the same resolved endpoint
//!   (the physical host identity; for the local store the `local` marker)
//!   with EQUAL canonical roots, or with one an ANCESTOR/DESCENDANT of the
//!   other, are refused at construction — before any filesystem mutation.
//!   The refusal happens against the process-global ownership registry, and
//!   the registration is released when the owning [`OwnedRoot`] (and the
//!   store holding it) is dropped: two SIMULTANEOUS owners over overlapping
//!   state are refused, while a released root can be re-owned.
//!
//! The store's mutations are additionally descriptor-relative ON UNIX (see
//! [`crate::atomic`]'s `_fd` primitives): every mutation resolves paths
//! component-wise relative to the owned root's open directory descriptor with
//! `openat(O_NOFOLLOW)`, so a symlink injected into a path component can never
//! redirect a mutation outside the owned root. The Windows port is path-based
//! (`crate::atomic::COMPONENT_CONFINED` is `false` there), so this confinement
//! is the UNIX arm's.
