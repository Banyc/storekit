//! The crate's RESERVED name spellings — the ONE authority for "is this
//! spelling reserved".
//!
//! Some names inside a store are the crate's own bookkeeping, never the
//! caller's content. Two are reserved today:
//!
//! * the CLAIM-ASIDE namespace, every name beginning with
//!   [`ASIDE_PREFIX`] (`.sync-aside.`): the temporary names a sync uses to move
//!   an entry aside while it replaces it;
//! * the operation-LOCK record spelling `.<name>.operation.lock` (a
//!   dot-prefixed sibling of a destination root, carrying a non-empty
//!   `<name>`): the record [`crate::sync::destination_lock_path`] derives and
//!   [`crate::lock::FileLock`] holds.
//!
//! The predicate lives HERE, once, because it is consulted from three places
//! that must never disagree:
//!
//! * [`crate::id::valid_name`] refuses a reserved spelling, so an identity the
//!   crate ACCEPTS is always a name the crate can replicate through a
//!   whole-store sync and destroy through its sanctioned delete route;
//! * [`crate::sync::apply`] strips reserved components from BOTH manifests
//!   before the diff, so a reserved entry is never transferred, never removed
//!   by [`crate::sync::Extraneous::Delete`], and is reported for the caller
//!   (a source collision as a `ReservedName` conflict, a destination entry as
//!   `SyncReport::residue`);
//! * a CONSUMER can ask before it fails: [`is_unaddressable_name`] answers
//!   "may I use this name?" for a single segment and
//!   [`is_unaddressable_path`] for a canonical manifest path. (The
//!   byte-exact [`is_reserved_name`] / [`is_reserved_path`] do NOT answer that
//!   question on their own: they are the narrow reserved MATCH the sync uses
//!   for stripping, and deliberately leave the application lock record and the
//!   case/trailing-dot aliases alone.)
//!
//! A reserved name is matched as a whole path COMPONENT, byte-exactly: the
//! check never decodes, normalizes, or case-folds, so a name that merely
//! RESEMBLES a reserved spelling without being an ALIAS of one is ordinary
//! content. Two spellings that are not byte-identical but CASE-FOLD onto one
//! another are the SAME directory entry on a case-insensitive filesystem
//! (macOS APFS by default, Windows by default), so the id/name rule refuses
//! such an alias ([`is_reserved_case_alias`]) even though the byte-exact
//! reserved MATCH above leaves it alone: `.SYNC-ASIDE.1` IS `.sync-aside.1`,
//! and `.DESTROOT.OPERATION.LOCK` IS `.destroot.operation.lock`.
//!
//! The application-store lock record's own name — the bare `operation.lock`
//! that [`crate::lock::FileLock`] holds at a store root — is likewise not one
//! of the two byte-exact reserved families, but it is unaddressable as an
//! identity ([`APPLICATION_LOCK_NAME`]): accepting it would let consumer
//! content share the name of the crate's own lock record.
//!
//! [`is_unaddressable_name`] is the ONE authority for "the crate may not name
//! this": the id rule ([`crate::id::valid_name`]) consults it, and the sync's
//! manifest-path model consults its path form ([`is_unaddressable_path`]), so
//! a spelling the crate refuses as an id is EXACTLY a spelling a whole-store
//! sync refuses to transfer or destroy. It refuses the crate's own TEMP shapes
//! (and their case aliases) as well as the reserved/lock spellings, so the
//! documented recovery sweep ([`crate::atomic::is_crate_temp_name`]) can never
//! delete addressable content. The crate's mutating primitives consult
//! the lock-record subset ([`is_lock_record_name`]) through the ONE guard
//! authority (`crate::atomic::guard`), so the record's stable inode cannot be
//! unlinked, replaced, truncated, or renamed through the substrate's
//! name-mutating funnel. The SAME guard consults the RESIDUE subset
//! ([`is_residue_name`]) on every component, so a mutating primitive can no
//! longer destroy a stranded aside that HOLDS an original; the sanctioned
//! breaks are the explicit [`crate::sync::Residue::discard`], the engine's own
//! claim-aside walk, and the sanctioned rename that creates or moves an aside.

// Only the tests spell a host `Path`; the production predicates split the
// MANIFEST model on `/` directly.

/// * the crate's OWN lock protocol mutates a lock record on purpose.

///   primitives mint [`crate::atomic::GuardedRel`] through
///   [`crate::atomic::GuardedRel::new_for_owned_lock_record`], which refuses
///   every lock-record spelling other than the record that IS the layout
///   lock's on-disk entry (identity — the resolved device/inode — with a
///   byte-exact spelling fallback only while that entry does not exist yet),
///   so a bare `operation.lock`, a nested `snapshots/.001.operation.lock`, a
///   case/dot alias that resolves to a DISTINCT entry, or any other spelling
///   can no longer be claimed away. The recognition is IDENTITY-based rather
///   than spelling-fold-based on purpose: a fold is sound for refusing a
///   spelling but unsound for authorizing a mutation, because it would grant
///   ownership of a different on-disk entry a live holder owns.
/// * the PATH-BASED helpers the manifest/retention machinery uses take an
///   ordinary path. `set_private`,
///   `ensure_private_dir_durable`, the PATH-BASED `write_atomic_replace`, and
///   the descriptor-relative `set_private_fd` now consult the guard too. The
///   local transport's crate-INTERNAL staged-publish workers
///   (`durable_create_new`, `remove_file_if_inner`) run INSIDE the funnel:
///   each takes a [`crate::atomic::GuardedRel`] capability that
///   `GuardedRel::new_for_owned_lock_record` mints only after the guard has
///   run, so their rename/remove/create on the crate's own temp/swap names is
///   the funnel's own code, not a path around it. The production mutation
///   sites that do NOT consult the guard are a CLASS defined by RULE, not a
///   count: a site whose only protection is its OWN naming or its own
///   naming-check rather than the reserved-spelling guard. Three such sites
///   exist today — the transport's own destination-root/layout DIRECTORY
///   creation (`create_dir_all` on `self.base` and its bootstrap dirs, which
///   creates directories the caller names OUTRIGHT rather than mutating an
///   existing NAME the guard owns); the private ssh hostkey cache's
///   drop-and-re-pin `remove_file`/create under the transport's own resolved
///   `cache_dir` (`hostkey.rs`), a path derived from the transport's private
///   cache and never from a caller's store-relative name; and the verbatim
///   copier described in the next bullet (`copy_tree_verbatim`, whose whole
///   contract is to CARRY reserved and temp spellings — including through
///   `platform::symlink_verbatim`, the ONE deliberately unguarded symlink
///   creator). None can be steered to the record's spelling, and each is
///   exempt for its OWN naming reason, so the class is stated as a rule rather
///   than as a count to keep in step. The AUTHORITATIVE list of which module
///   may spell which disallowed symbol is `clippy.toml`'s comment plus the
///   per-module `#![allow(clippy::disallowed_methods)]`s — consult those
///   rather than keeping a second list here.
///   `copy_tree_verbatim` is the ONE production path-based copy that
///   deliberately CARRIES reserved and temp spellings into its destination, so
///   it does not consult the guard — and does not need to. It never REMOVES,
///   RENAMES or REPLACES a destination entry (every entry is created new and a
///   pre-existing one is refused), so it cannot free or swap the record's
///   inode and cannot split a holder; and its destination is documented NOT to
///   be a store root. The NAME states the weakness (API constraint #8,
///   verdict N), while the strict, root-confined [`crate::atomic::copy_dir_recursive_fd`]
///   still refuses every unaddressable name. The
