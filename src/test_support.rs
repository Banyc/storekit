//! The source crate's test utilities carry a whole application fixture
//! vocabulary; only the four environment/tmpdir/proptest helpers are generic,

//!
//! The module is test-only and shared by suites that land in separate waves,
//! so a helper no current suite calls is not a defect: the dead-code lint is
//! allowed here rather than letting one suite's unused helper fail another's
