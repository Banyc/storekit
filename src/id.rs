//! The validated identity newtype machinery.
//!
//! A value that names something in a store must be a safe single path
//! segment: the crate stores validated names VERBATIM, so the valid set must
//! be injective into the filesystem — on the case-sensitive,
//! trailing-dot-preserving addressing the crate canonicalizes against. The
//! folding-host residual is stated at [`valid_name`]. The
//! [`crate::id_newtype!`] macro wraps such a validated string in a newtype whose
//! construction validates the invariant, so an invalid value cannot exist.
//!
//! The composition here is deliberately small and domain-free:
//!
//! * [`crate::id_newtype!`] — the validated newtype, with
//!   `parse`/`FromStr`/`TryFrom` and a serde `Deserialize` that routes every
//!   wire string through the same validation (fail closed). There is
//!   deliberately NO `Default` and no unchecked production constructor: an
//!   empty identity would be a malformed durable record constructible by
//!   anyone;
//! * [`valid_name`] — the single-safe-segment name rule, which ALSO refuses
//!   the crate's UNADDRESSABLE spellings
//!   ([`crate::reserved::is_unaddressable_name`] — the SAME authority
//!   [`crate::reserved::is_reserved_name`] is narrower than, because it
//!   additionally covers the application lock record, every case alias and
//!   every crate-temp shape): a
//!   name the crate accepts is always a name a whole-store sync can replicate
//!   and its sanctioned delete route can destroy. A consumer can ask the
//!   question directly through that public predicate;
//! * [`valid_hex_digest`] — the exactly-64-lowercase-hex sha256 rule;
//! * [`Identifier`] — the worked example newtype built from [`valid_name`].

/// replicate. No re-encoding is needed: the valid set is already
/// filesystem-safe, so on a CASE-SENSITIVE, TRAILING-DOT-PRESERVING filesystem
/// two distinct valid names map to two distinct path components.
///
/// That guarantee is SCOPED to that addressing, and the scope is the honest
/// boundary rather than a hedge. On a folding host it does NOT hold for
/// ordinary names, and no validation of a SINGLE name can restore it:
/// `A`/`a`, and `a.`/`a`, are one directory entry on Windows and on default
/// APFS, and each is a collision between TWO distinct names rather than a
/// property of either one. The crate's own BOOKKEEPING is still protected
/// there — the reserved-spelling denial above already folds case and strips a
/// trailing `.`/` `, so no valid name can alias a lock record, a claim aside or
/// a temp shape on any supported host. A caller that needs two ids to stay
/// distinct on a folding host must not choose names that fold together.
///
/// RESIDUAL: a trailing `.`/` ` is the one half of that alias a per-name rule
/// COULD close, by refusing it. It is left open and stated here rather than
/// closed, with its reach: on a folding host two ids differing only by a
/// trailing `.`/` ` address one entry, and the crate does not refuse the
/// spelling. (A `.` elsewhere is unaffected — `a.b` is one component on every
/// supported host.)
///
/// The reason it is not closed is not convenience, and it is worth writing
/// down because the opposite choice looks free: this rule also validates
/// HOST- and USER-like scalars, and for those a trailing `.` is the legitimate
/// ABSOLUTE spelling (`example.com.` is a valid FQDN and resolvers and
/// provisioning tools emit it). Refusing the spelling would reject a real value
/// and push a normalization the crate cannot perform onto every consumer. So
/// of the two halves, the case-fold half is impossible to close per name and
