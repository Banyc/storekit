//! THE shared bounded child-runner for local command execution: the ONE owner
//! of every local command child, from spawn to the mandatory reap.
//!
//! # The lifecycle contract
//!
//! `LocalTransport::exec` used to split the child between the caller and a
//! DETACHED reaping thread and, on timeout, fire-and-forget an external
//! `kill -9 <pid>` and return a SUCCESSFUL timeout outcome — before the child
//! was proven dead and reaped, with a kill failure silently ignored and only
//! the direct child (never its process GROUP) signalled. This runner replaces
//! that with a bounded lifecycle:
//!
//! * **Synchronized child ownership** — the runner owns the `Child` handle
//!   exclusively from spawn until the single reap. There is no detached
//!   thread that can outlive the call, and no path that drops the handle
//!   un-reaped: the drop backstop kills and waits (bounded) as a final
//!   resort, so a live child is never abandoned even on an error path that
//!   cannot complete the reap itself.
//! * **Process-group termination (Unix)** — the child is spawned into its
//!   OWN process group (`process_group(0)` — the child becomes the group
//!   leader, pgid == pid), so a timeout terminates the WHOLE group (`killpg`
//!   SIGTERM, then — after a short grace — SIGKILL) and GRANDCHILDREN die
//!   with it. Windows has no process groups: the timeout terminates the
//!   direct child only (a background descendant survives).
//! * **Mandatory wait/join before returning** — every returned outcome
//!   (success, timeout, error) happens only after the child was REAPED: the
//!   runner waits synchronously on its owned handle, `try_wait` consumes the
//!   exit status exactly once, and "proven dead" means the wait returned.
//! * **Foreground-only (Unix)** — commands must not daemonize. After the
//!   direct child exits, the runner checks its process group for LIVE
//!   leftover members (a background descendant the command left behind). The
//!   check is race-free by construction: the child is held as an UNREAPED
//!   ZOMBIE for its duration (`waitid(2)` with `WNOWAIT` — a zombie holds
//!   its pid, and therefore its process-group id (the child is the group
//!   leader, pgid == pid), allocated until reaped, so a `killpg` in that
//!   window can never hit a pid the OS recycled for an unrelated process),
//!   the group is ENUMERATED (Linux: a `/proc/*/stat` scan; macOS:
//!   `proc_listpgrp`) with our own zombie excluded, and any LIVE leftover
//!   member triggers the termination (TERM, grace, KILL — the timeout path's
//!   escalation) plus an ERROR — a command that leaves background processes
//!   is a contract violation, NEVER a successful outcome. The foreground
//!   containment INVARIANT (no live process after the return) covers
//!   IN-GROUP descendants only. A descendant that ESCAPED the group via
//!   `setsid` is OUTSIDE the guarantee: the runner can DETECT a
//!   pipe-holding escapee — the inherited stdio pipes EOF exactly when the
//!   last holder dies, so a pipe still open at the drain bound is a provable
//!   violation → error — but it CANNOT TERMINATE an escaped process, because
//!   no portable way to signal a process outside its group exists without
//!   cgroups/subreaper support (Linux) or a remote supervisor (ssh). The ONE
//!   documented exclusion covers BOTH setsid flavors: the pipe-holding
//!   escapee (detected → error, but not terminated) and the FULLY daemonized
//!   descendant (`setsid` AND closed descriptors — not even detectable);
//!   commands must not daemonize. A CLEAN command (no live members —
//!   the common case) pays one enumeration and its exit code and captured
//!   output are exactly as before. On Windows the foreground-only check is
//!   NOT performed (no process-group enumeration exists).
//! * **A timeout-kill failure is an ERROR** — if the group kill fails (a real
//!   failure, not the benign ESRCH of a group that is already gone), or the
//!   escalated kill fails, or the reap cannot be confirmed within the bound,
//!   the runner returns `Err` — NEVER a successful `exit_code: -1,
//!   "timed out"` outcome. Only a confirmed terminated-and-reaped group yields
//!   the timeout outcome.
//! * **Bounded** — the lifecycle is bounded: per-exec, no leaked threads
//!   (there are none), no leaked handles, no live processes across calls, and
//!   every kill/reap wait is bounded by a configurable deadline.
//!
//! The kill path is a [`KillSeam`] (a kill-function seam): production uses
//! [`RealKill`] (Unix: `killpg(2)` — no shell, no external `kill` binary;
//! Windows: the owned `Child::kill`), and the property test injects
//! syscall-level faults (a missing/unavailable kill, EPERM, ESRCH, an inert
//! kill) without any subprocess fakery. The process group + escalation
//! primitives are shared with the SSH runner's real seam
//! ([`kill_process_group`], [`TERM_TO_KILL_GRACE`]), so both transports
//! terminate process groups, not bare pids.
//!
//! # The platform split (ONE cfg switch at the module boundary)
//!
//! The platform-dependent lifecycle — spawn (process group vs plain), the
//! wait loop (`waitid` WNOWAIT peek vs `try_wait` poll), termination
//! (`killpg` vs `Child::kill`), the foreground-only check (group enumeration
//! vs none), and the pipe drain (`poll`/`fcntl` non-blocking vs reader
//! threads) — lives in the [`unix`] / `windows` submodules, selected by
//! the TWO `mod` declarations below. The rest of the crate calls the
//! re-exported surface and never sees the switch.
//!
//! # The shared liveness decision (single-sourced PER PLATFORM)
//!
//! "Is this process a LIVE member of the group?" must have exactly ONE
//! answer within a platform, or production's enumeration and the test oracle
//! drift (the bug that motivated this rule: an oracle that counted
//! `EXIT_DEAD` as live while production did not). The decision is
//! single-sourced per platform — NOT by one cross-platform predicate,
//! because the two kernels report a process's state in incompatible shapes:
//!
//! * Linux — `is_live_state` over the `/proc/<pid>/stat` state CHARACTER:
//!   `X` (`EXIT_DEAD`) and `Z` (`EXIT_ZOMBIE`) are not live; every other
//!   state, including an unknown one, is live. Production's
//!   `live_group_members` and the oracle's `probe_process` both call it.
//! * macOS — `unix::macos_status_is_not_live` over the BSD process STATUS
//!   (a number): `SZOMB` (= 5) is not live; every other status is live.
//!   Production reads the status as `pbi_status` through
//!   `proc_pidinfo(PROC_PIDTBSDINFO)`; the oracle reads it as `p_stat`
//!   through `sysctl(KERN_PROC_PID)` (it also needs the start-time token,
//!   and `proc_pidinfo` describes no zombie). The accessors differ; the
//!   decision is the one function.
