//! The Windows implementation of the bounded child-runner: no process
//! groups (the child is spawned plain and terminated via the OWNED handle),
//! no foreground-only group check (no process-group enumeration exists on
//! Windows), and reader THREADS for the pipe drains (no `poll`/`fcntl`
//! non-blocking pipes). The documented weaker guarantees of the Windows
//! port: a background descendant survives a timeout (only the direct child
//! is terminated), and a command that leaves background processes is
//! detected only when it holds the output pipes (the bounded drain reports
//! the violation; a fully daemonized descendant is outside the contract, as
//! on Unix). Selected by the single `#[cfg(windows)]` `mod` declaration in
//! [`super`].
