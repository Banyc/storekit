//! The transport stack: connectivity to one server's remote root.
//!
//! The [`Remote`] trait plus the in-process [`LocalTransport`] lead this
//! module; the production SSH transport over `ssh`/`scp`, host-identity
//! verification and pinning (a strict known-hosts file or a pre-verified
//! fingerprint, never trust-on-first-use), and the ONE bounded subprocess
//! runner every ssh operation goes through live in the `ssh` submodule group.
//!
//! Transport setup is split into two phases: [`Remote::prepare_identity`]
//! (verify/pin the host key) runs before ANY remote request — including a dry
//! run's status inspection — while [`Remote::provision_layout`] (create the
//! deployment-directory layout) runs only behind the push engine's
//! non-dry-run gate.
//!
//! # Submodules
//!
//! * `runner` — the shared bounded child-runner: synchronized child
//!   ownership, process-group termination, and mandatory wait/reap before
//!   every returned outcome (used by [`LocalTransport::exec`]).
//! * `scripted` — the deterministic fake exec the property tests inject
//!   (test-only): scripted outcomes keyed by argv, no subprocess, no
//!   wall-clock — the parallel-safety seam.
//! * `ssh` — the SSH transport group: the [`SshTransport`] itself plus
//!   host-key verification (`ssh::hostkey`) and the bounded subprocess
//!   runner (`ssh::runner`).
//!
//! # Symlink-component confinement
//!
//! On Unix, every [`LocalTransport`] operation that resolves a NON-EMPTY
//! root-relative path BELOW the root does so COMPONENT-WISE from an fd-pinned
//! root with `openat(O_NOFOLLOW)` (see the `FD-CONFINED OPERATIONS` block on
//! the impl): a symlink injected at ANY component below the root is REFUSED,
//! never followed, with NO check-then-act window — the same guarantee the
//! crate's fd-confined `Side::Local` destination gives. That includes the
//! READS used as verification sources — `read`, `read_link`, and `metadata_opt`
//! (and therefore `metadata`, `kind_opt`/`mode_opt` over a [`Remote`], and the
//! [`Remote::exists`] default that delegates to `metadata_opt`) — so a
//! content/kind/mode verdict can never be computed from an
//! object outside the pinned root.
//!
//! The operations that are NOT component-wise confined are named precisely, and
//! each is documented at its definition:
//!
//! * the destination ROOT listing ([`Remote::list`] with the EMPTY path) is
//!   path-based ([`LocalTransport::list_path_based`]): `read_dir_fd` refuses the
//!   empty path, and the root path itself is the trusted anchor — the residual
//!   ROOT-swap race is the one this module documents;
//! * the durability helpers [`Remote::fsync_parent`] and [`Remote::fsync_tree`]
//!   open their directories by path (they fsync; they never redirect a
//!   mutation or source a verification verdict);
//! * [`Remote::provision_layout`] creates the caller-supplied BOOTSTRAP
//!   directories by path (`base.join(d)`), not by `mkdirat` — a trusted layout
//!   name, not destination content the applier resolves;
//! * [`Remote::copy_tree`] inherits the default list/read/write walk, which is
//!   component-wise confined for every non-root path it visits, but is not a
//!   single fd-pinned operation;
//! * the `#[cfg(not(unix))]` Windows bodies are path-based (the Windows port has
//!   no directory descriptors), the documented weaker guarantee of that port.
//!
//! The [`SshTransport`] far side is a shell script this crate may not change
//! (the `ssh` submodule group), so it CANNOT give that guarantee on its own.
//! There the applier's `sync` preflight is the guarantee: every destination
//! mutation first verifies, with `lstat`, that every strict ancestor component
//! is a REAL directory, so a PRE-EXISTING symlink component is refused before
//! the operation runs. A component SWAPPED between that preflight check and the
//! operation remains a residual race — the same class as the already-documented
//! root-swap race — and is NOT claimed to be closed for `SshTransport`.
//!
//! The transport is application-domain-free: the on-server layout (bootstrap
//! directories, the operation-lock paths, and the immutable receiver marker)
//! is the caller-supplied [`Layout`]; the receiver identity is the opaque
//! [`ReceiverId`].

/// A local destination is owned by a `flock` on a record file this host can

/// far-side holder alive for the run — [`SshTransport`] spawns a long-lived
/// `ssh` client whose remote `perl` takes a non-blocking `flock` on the SAME
/// record the local case uses and then blocks reading its stdin.
///
/// The session ends when the guard is DROPPED (a normal return, an error
/// return, and a panic unwind all run `Drop`), when [`Self::release`] is
/// called, or when the CONNECTION DIES. A dropped connection therefore
/// releases the record: the far-side holder sees EOF on the closed channel
/// and exits, and the kernel releases the `flock` when its process dies. Two
/// consequences a caller MUST internalise, and the crate states rather than
/// hides:
///
/// * **A far-side lock cannot outlive its client.** It serialises CONCURRENT
///   runs that cooperate on the record, but it is NOT a lease: if the client
///   dies, the lock is gone while any far-side work it triggered may not be.
/// * **A connection lost mid-run is reported, never a clean success.** A run
///   checks [`Self::is_alive`] before returning; a dead session turns the run
///   into a typed transport error naming the lost lock, because the
///   destination is no longer exclusively owned at that point.
///
/// # What a third-party implementor must do

/// [`Remote::lock_far_side`] has a DEFAULT that REFUSES (fail closed), so a
