//! Canonical tree metadata: the manifest.
//!
//! The canonical tree objects ([`canonicalize_tree`], [`compute_tree_digest`],
//! [`entry_paths`]) lead this module; they define the one canonical format for
//! a tree of bytes.
//!
//! The canonical format is a cross-module contract: the store verifies objects
//! against it, recovery re-hashes with it, and the SSH transport must preserve
//! exactly these bytes on upload. Any module that serializes or transfers tree
//! bytes diverging from this format silently breaks digest equality for every
//! other verifier.
//!
//! # Names are on-disk names: NFC UTF-8, or the tree is refused
//!
//! The manifest's paths are the entries' ON-DISK names, so an entry path is
//! stored exactly as the filesystem spells it (joined with `/`): valid UTF-8
//! and already NFC. Canonicalization therefore REFUSES a tree containing a
//! name that is not valid UTF-8 or not already NFC, with an error that names
//! the offending entry, instead of converting or normalizing it. This is
//! deliberate: the stored path is used to ADDRESS the file downstream, and
//! storing a normalized spelling names a path that does not exist on a
//! normalization-sensitive filesystem (Linux/ext4) — the sync would either
//! fail to find the file or, worse, report success while leaving the
//! destination holding both spellings. The two canonicalizers (the local walk
//! and the remote wire assembler) apply the same rule, so they accept exactly
//! the same trees.
//!
//! # Symlink targets are link data: UTF-8, wire-clean, and non-escaping
//!
//! A symlink target is the LINK CONTENT, a byte string the kernel dereferences
//! literally, and the manifest stores it as a UTF-8 [`String`] on a line- and
//! tab-separated wire. Canonicalization therefore REFUSES (never truncates,
//! never lossily converts) a target that is not valid UTF-8 or that contains
//! any `WIRE_UNREPRESENTABLE_CHARS` character (NUL, LF, CR, or TAB). LF and
//! TAB are the wire separators; CR is refused because a CRLF-folding line
//! reader (Rust's `str::lines`, which the assembler must not use) strips a CR
//! that ends a line, and the LAST wire field is the target — a target ending
//! in CR would be silently truncated and then re-hashed, hiding the
//! divergence; NUL cannot be a C string. Any of them would make the stored
//! spelling address a DIFFERENT path than the on-disk link. The raw target
//! bytes are what the content hash binds, so the two canonicalizers must agree
//! on them exactly.
//!
//! A target is NOT `separator-free`. It may contain `/` (multi-component, e.g.
//! `sub/target`) and `..`, because it is link DATA the kernel resolves, and a
//! separator or a `..` is not by itself an escape. What the rules forbid is an
//! ABSOLUTE target, and a RELATIVE target whose resolution leaves the tree
//! root — and the resolution base is the directory CONTAINING the link (its own
//! parent), as POSIX specifies, not the tree root. So `dir/link -> ../other`
//! resolves to `<root>/other` and is ACCEPTED, while `dir/link ->
//! ../../outside` resolves outside the root and is REFUSED.
//!
//! # Containment is decided PHYSICALLY, on the TARGET's components
//!
//! The kernel resolves a relative target PHYSICALLY: it walks the SPELLED
//! components in order and `..` moves to the physical parent of whatever it
//! has reached, so a lexical `..`-collapse is faithful ONLY while no component
//! it walks is a symlink. A `..` that follows a symlink component is exactly
//! where the collapse and the kernel disagree: with `dir/sub -> ../other`,
//! `dir/link -> sub/../../outside` collapses to `<root>/outside` (inside,
//! because the first `..` undoes `sub`), while the kernel WALKS THROUGH
//! `dir/sub` to `<root>/../other`, so the next `..` reaches the root's parent
//! and the target leaves the root. The kernel also FOLLOWS the FINAL component,
//! so a target that ends at a symlink can leave the root even when its spelling
//! never pops above it. The rule therefore refuses a relative target as soon as
//! the walk reaches a component (final or intermediate) that is a symlink, and
//! refuses a `..` that pops above the root: the collapse is never trusted past
//! a symlink. This is the crate's fail-closed doctrine — refuse rather than
//! guess where a follow ends.
//!
//! The walk is over root-RELATIVE paths and never builds an absolute base, so
//! it does not depend on the root's spelling. Both manifest call sites now
//! answer "does this component resolve to a symlink?" from the SAME
//! [`SymlinkContainmentIndex`] they build from their own entry list — the local
//! walk from the entries its `WalkDir` produced, the assembler from the entries
//! the far side's listing produced — and both apply the crate's ONE
//! containment fold (full Unicode case fold, Unicode NFC around it, trailing
//! `.`/space; see [`fold_component`]). Neither canonicalizes the root, so a root reached
//! through a symlink can no longer make the two verdicts differ, and because
//! the fold is platform-independent the two views cannot disagree about the
//! same tree on any host. (Before this the local walk asked `symlink_metadata`
//! of the live tree while the assembler compared the listing's spellings
//! byte-exactly, so on a case- or normalization-folding filesystem the local
//! view refused a target the wire view accepted: an exact-string lookup is not
//! the kernel's resolution, and the divergence was an under-refusal by the
//! wire view.)
//!
//! # The fold, and the residual it costs
//!
//! The fold is deliberately PLATFORM-INDEPENDENT, exactly like the crate's
//! reserved-name rules ([`crate::reserved::is_unaddressable_name`]): a manifest
//! must mean the same thing on every host, and a manifest accepted against a
//! case-SENSITIVE source must not escape when it is materialized on a
//! case-/normalization-folding destination. An EXACT entry always WINS over a
//! fold-equal one, so a lawful tree that merely has a case-variant sibling
//! (`Sub` a directory and `sub` a symlink, which can coexist only on a
//! case-sensitive filesystem) is still accepted when the target names the
//! non-symlink entry. What the fold costs is the choice of ERRING DIRECTION: a
//! target component that has NO exact entry but fold-matches a symlink entry is
//! REFUSED even on a case-sensitive filesystem, where the kernel would instead
//! fail the lookup (`ENOENT`) and the link would simply dangle. That is a
//! fail-closed over-refusal, and it is the residual this rule accepts rather
//! than letting the two views — or two hosts — disagree about the same tree.
//!
//! CORRECTION (this revision): the paragraph above was written when the fold
//! was `str::to_lowercase`, and the claim that the fold's only cost is a
//! fail-closed over-refusal was FALSE of that fold. `to_lowercase` UNDER-folds
//! a case-insensitive host (`ß` stays `ß` instead of `ss`, `ﬁ` stays `ﬁ`
//! instead of `fi`, FINAL SIGMA stays itself instead of `σ`, long s stays `ſ`
//! instead of `s`), so a target component the kernel resolved onto a symlink
//! was answered `Absent` and ACCEPTED — an under-refusal, i.e. an escape, not
//! an over-refusal. The fold is now the FULL Unicode case fold
//! ([`crate::casefold`]), applied to the NFD-DECOMPOSED component
//! (`NFC(case_fold(NFD(name)))`; see [`fold_component`]) — the Unicode default
//! caseless match the host filesystems implement. The macOS APFS half of that
//! claim is DEMONSTRATED, not asserted:
//! `the_fold_agrees_with_the_host_on_the_measured_families` probes the live
//! filesystem with a real write and a cross-spelling lookup for the measured
//! families, and the three Greek precomposed perispomeni+ypogegrammeni pairs
//! are covered end to end by the `greek_*` tests in
//! `tests/casefold_confinement.rs`. The Linux `ext4 -O casefold` half was NOT
//! re-run in this environment (`ser` was unreachable), so the claim for that
//! host rests only on the fold being the Unicode C+F caseless match and is
//! left UNVERIFIED here rather than asserted. The over-refusal residual above
//! is now true, and the added over-refusal is exactly the extra spellings those
//! hosts fold together and a case-sensitive host would leave dangling
//! (`straße`/`SS`, `ﬁle`/`FILE`, `ς`/`σ`, ...): refused on every host, which is
//! the safe direction for a decision that otherwise GRANTS acceptance.
//!
//! CORRECTION (this revision) to the fold's ORDER: the previous revision
//! folded `NFC(name)` first, then case-folded. Unicode caseless matching is
//! NFD-based, so that order is not canonical-equivalence-safe: it diverges for
//! exactly three code points — U+1FB7, U+1FC7, and U+1FF7 (the Greek
//! precomposed perispomeni+ypogegrammeni forms). Their canonically-related
//! capital spellings (`U+1FBC U+0342`, `U+1FCC U+0342`, `U+1FFC U+0342`, and the
//! fully decomposed `U+0391 U+0342 U+0345` family) fold to a DIFFERENT string,
//! so the index answered `Absent` for a component the kernel resolves to a
//! symlink and the escape was ACCEPTED. Taking the NFD first makes both
//! spellings fold to the same key (`NFC(case_fold(NFD(·)))`).
//!
//! This section is also the corrected RESIDUAL LIST for the physical-walk
//! change. The previous revision claimed no legitimate tree was newly refused
//! except the target that ends at a symlink and the target that reaches an
//! exactly-spelled symlink component; that list was INCOMPLETE. The complete
//! list of what this rule refuses is:
//!
//! 1. A relative target that ends at a symlink, or that reaches a symlink
//!    component with an exact spelling.
//! 2. A relative target whose spelled walk reaches a component with NO exact
//!    entry that FOLD-MATCHES a symlink entry (the fold residual above): refused
//!    on EVERY host, including a case-sensitive one where the link would dangle.
//! 3. An EMPTY symlink target, refused by BOTH views
//!    ([`validate_symlink_target`]). Before this the local walk accepted `""`
//!    (an empty path has no components) while the wire assembler refused it, so
//!    a macOS source (APFS stores an empty-target link) was accepted by one
//!    view and refused by the other.
//! 4. A SOURCE link whose target walks through a component that a DESTINATION
//!    symlink occupies under `Extraneous::Keep`: the RUN refuses, because
//!    containment is a property of the RESULT, not of the source alone (see
//!    `crate::sync`). The destination entry is never silently removed — removal
//!    is the caller's `Extraneous` decision — so a `Keep` run refuses and the
//!    caller must clear the component (or the source link) first.
//!
//! The root-relative walk is also the only rule that keeps containment
//! PORTABLE, which is the property a manifest must have: a target that stays in
//! the root only because the root happens to be NAMED a particular name (e.g.
//! `dir/link -> ../../real/other` when the root is `.../real`) leaves the root
//! as soon as the tree is materialized under any other name. Checking it
//! against the resolved real root would accept a tree whose containment is a
//! coincidence of the root's spelling, so such a target is refused.
//!
//! The earlier version of this section got the argument wrong in a way worth
//! recording: it argued only about the LINK'S PARENT components (which the walk
//! had already verified as real directories) and never about the TARGET's
//! components — the half whose treatment the resolution base had just changed.
//! A safety argument must cover the part of the input whose treatment can
//! change, not the part that was already correct.
//!
//! NFC is deliberately NOT required of a target. A name is an index into the
//! tree, but a target is DATA: the kernel resolves it verbatim, it may contain
//! `..` and `/` separators, and normalizing it would silently repoint the link
//! (and change the hash that binds the link's content). Refusing non-NFC
//! targets would reject
//! legitimate links that merely happen to spell their target in a decomposed
//! form; accepting them verbatim is faithful and keeps both canonicalizers in
//! agreement. Only the UTF-8 half of the NAME rule is applied to targets; the
//! NFC half is not.
//!
//! # Fidelity scope: what a sync carries, and what it silently does not
//!
//! A sync transports THIS manifest plus the file bytes, and the manifest
//! model is exactly the fields of [`TreeEntry`] — so fidelity is bounded by
//! them. This section is the crate's authoritative statement of scope: every
//! item under "carried" was verified end to end, and every item under "not
//! carried" is a deliberate, currently-unimplemented limitation rather than
//! a guarantee. A caller must be able to read this and predict the result
//! without experimenting.
//!
//! **CARRIED faithfully:** the entry's path name (NFC UTF-8, `/`-separated;
//! see above), its kind (file, directory, or symlink), its mode INCLUDING
//! the setuid/setgid/sticky bits (stored as the full octal mode and applied
//! with an explicit `chmod`, so a permissive umask cannot narrow it), the
//! file's content (the SHA-256-bound bytes), and a symlink's target (the raw
//! target bytes).
//!
//! **NOT carried — silently dropped.** The manifest has no field for any of
//! these, so a sync neither reproduces nor REPORTS them:
//!
//! * **ownership** (`uid`/`gid`) — a destination entry ends up owned by the
//!   transferring account;
//! * **extended attributes** — Linux `user.*` and `security.*` (including
//!   `security.capability`) and macOS `com.apple.*` (resource forks,
//!   `com.apple.FinderInfo`);
//! * **POSIX access and default ACLs**;
//! * **timestamps** (`mtime`/`atime`);
//! * **file flags** (`chattr +i`, `chflags uchg`);
//! * **sparseness** — a sparse file is written out fully allocated;
//! * **memory** — a sync reads each file WHOLE: the local canonicalizer
//!   ([`canonicalize_tree`]'s `std::fs::read`) and the far-side perl
//!   manifest script both slurp the entire file in one allocation, so peak
//!   resident memory is proportional to the LARGEST SINGLE FILE, not to the
//!   tree's total size. This is a PER-FILE bound, not a total-tree bound,
//!   and no streaming path exists. (Measured: a 512 MiB file → ~515 MiB RSS;
//!   a 2 GiB file → ~2.00 GiB RSS.)
//!
//! The loss of xattrs, `security.capability`, and ACLs is INVISIBLE TO THE
//! DIFFER: a second sync compares only the manifest model, sees the entry as
//! already `Same`, and reports success, so only xattr/ACL-aware tooling on
//! the destination can reveal the divergence.
//!
//! **NOT carried — REFUSED, not dropped:** a hard link (an entry with
//! `nlink > 1`) is rejected by BOTH canonicalizers — the local walk and the
//! remote wire assembler — with an error naming the entry, rather than being
//! silently materialized as two independent copies. Refusal is the crate's
//! doctrine for anything it cannot reproduce faithfully (the name and
//! symlink-target rules above follow the same principle): a silent
//! transformation that changes what the tree means is worse than a loud
//! failure.
//!
//! **Push and pull now mutate a destination the SAME way.** Both publish a
//! written file by ATOMIC RENAME into place (a NEW inode), so the replaced
//! file's pre-existing xattrs and owner are destroyed with the old inode in
//! BOTH directions. (Before a push was made atomic, a push overwrote the
//! bytes IN PLACE — the SSH transport's `cat >`, the local transport's
//! `O_TRUNC` create — and kept the old inode; that asymmetry, and the torn
//! destination a failed in-place push could leave, are gone.)
//!
//! **The manifest carries no TIMESTAMPS.** `TreeEntry` has no `mtime`/`atime`
//! field, so a caller that wants "the newest N snapshots" MUST derive the
//! order from the snapshot id's LEXICAL order (or keep its own timestamp
//! record): the manifest (and therefore the differ) cannot rank two entries
//! by time, and two snapshots whose only difference is a modification time
//! compare `Same`.
//!
//! # Durability and atomicity of a written entry
//!
//! The write discipline is chosen by the DESTINATION, never by the direction.
//! This is the statement a caller should read before relying on either:
//!
//! * **LOCAL destination** — a PULL's local root, OR a PUSH whose transport
//!   declares `is_local() == true` ([`crate::transport::LocalTransport`]):
//!   the entry is written by the crate's durable atomic replace
//!   ([`crate::atomic::write_atomic_replace_fd`]). A UNIQUE temp is created in
//!   the destination's own directory, chmodded private, `fsync`ed, then
//!   `renameat` into place (COMMIT POINT 1 — the new content becomes VISIBLE),
//!   then the PARENT DIRECTORY is `fsync`ed (COMMIT POINT 2 — the rename
//!   becomes DURABLE). A failure BEFORE the rename is an `Err` that leaves the
//!   PREVIOUS content wholly in place and unlinks the temp; a failure of the
//!   parent fsync AFTER the rename is
//!   [`crate::atomic::ReplaceOutcome::ReplacedDurabilityUnknown`] — the new
//!   content is VISIBLE but its durability is unconfirmed — NEVER a bare
//!   `Err` (a bare `Err` would falsely claim the rename never happened).
//! * **REMOTE destination** ([`crate::transport::SshTransport`]): the SAME
//!   protocol on the far side, in one POSIX shell command: a `mktemp` temp in
//!   the destination's own directory, the payload on STDIN into it, the final
//!   mode, a portable perl `fsync(2)` of the temp, a perl `rename(2)` INTO
//!   PLACE (overwriting the final entry atomically, never following a symlink),
//!   then a perl `fsync(2)` of the parent directory. Every operand is
//!   single-quoted, `--` precedes a value that may start with `-`, the parent
//!   is computed on this host (never by a far-side `dirname`), and the payload
//!   is never embedded in the command string. GNU and BSD userlands are both
//!   exercised by the far-side suites. A failure before the rename leaves the
//!   PREVIOUS content in place and removes the temp.
//! * **WINDOWS local destination**: the PATH-BASED replace
//!   ([`crate::atomic::write_atomic_replace`], the public UNCONFINED form as
//!   of API constraint #8, verdict N): a temp + rename with NO
//!   parent-directory fsync and a NON-atomic replace (Windows `rename` does
//!   not overwrite an existing target, so the target is removed first and a
//!   reader can observe a transient absence). This is the ONE destination kind
//!   that cannot be made atomic and durable here; the Windows port
//!   type-checks but is NOT exercised, so treat it as unverified.
//!
//! `EntryPolicy::AppendTail` adds a COMPARE before an append's write: the write
//! happens only if the destination still holds the bytes the append read, so a
//! concurrent modification becomes a REPORTED conflict rather than a silent
//! overwrite (see [`crate::sync`] for what the compare can and cannot cover).
//!
//! A caller that needs `security.capability`, ACLs, ownership, or timestamps
//! preserved must apply them out of band after the sync.
