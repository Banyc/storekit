//! The one error type every operation returns.
//!
//! The classes are the ones a caller must be able to tell apart, not the
//! modules that raise them: a mechanical I/O failure ([`Error::Io`]), a
//! record that is present but does not parse ([`Error::Json`]), a path or a
//! tree that is not what it claims to be ([`Error::Path`],
//! [`Error::Integrity`], [`Error::Materialization`]), a store mutation that
//! could not be made durable ([`Error::Store`]), a transport failure
//! ([`Error::Transport`]), and the closed refusals a caller reacts to
//! ([`Error::Preflight`], [`Error::NotFound`], [`Error::Ref`],
//! [`Error::Conflict`], [`Error::Reserved`], [`Error::LockContended`]).
//!
//! Within a class, where a caller has to DISTINGUISH one condition from
//! another in the same class, the condition is a TYPED value carried alongside
//! the message: [`MaterializationKind`], [`StoreKind`], [`TransportKind`],
//! [`PreflightKind`], and the pre-existing [`ReservedKind`]. The message is preserved VERBATIM
//! (the `Display` impl is byte-identical to the pre-typing one), so a caller
//! that already matches the text keeps working; the typed value is what a
//! caller should branch on. A class that carries no typed kind is one where
//! nothing in the crate — not a caller, not a test, not the crate's own
//! recovery advice — has to tell its conditions apart: the text is for a
//! human. `Error::materialization`/`store`/`transport` remain as the
//! untyped shorthand and produce the `Unclassified` kind.
