//! Manifest production for both sides of a transfer, and the typed,
//! path-ordered diff between them.
//!
//! REVIEW LABELS: the `F1`/`F2`/`F3` labels in this file's comments name its own
//! tests — `f1_a_script_die_that_propagates_126_or_127_is_the_far_side_script`,
//! `f1_a_real_interpreter_die_at_127_is_the_far_side_script`,
//! `f2_the_typed_cause_not_the_status_alone_classifies_the_deadline` and
//! `f3_the_real_at_255_spoof_vector_is_a_root_name_containing_a_raw_lf` (test
//! functions, so they are not links) — so a reader can resolve every one of them
//! here.
//!
//! A transfer starts by describing each side as a [`TreeMetadata`] manifest.
//! The LOCAL side is canonicalized directly
//! ([`crate::manifest::canonicalize_tree`]). The REMOTE side branches on
//! [`Remote::is_local`] — the transport's DECLARED nature, never a local
//! filesystem probe of the root path (a probe would silently hash a
//! same-named local directory in place of the remote tree). A local remote is
//! canonicalized directly; a genuinely remote one is hashed ON THE FAR SIDE by
//! the perl verification script
//! ([`crate::manifest::remote_tree_verify_script`]) run through
//! [`Remote::exec`], and the printed per-entry hashes are assembled with
//! [`crate::manifest::canonicalize_remote_entries`], so only hashes cross the
//! link — never the tree bytes.
//!
//! [`diff_trees`] classifies every path in the union of the two manifests as
//! [`EntryDiff::Missing`], [`EntryDiff::Changed`], [`EntryDiff::Extraneous`],
//! or [`EntryDiff::Same`], sorted by path. [`apply_manifests`] produces the
//! pair of manifests [`crate::sync::apply`] actually diffs — the raw
//! primitives' result with the crate's reserved bookkeeping stripped, through
//! the crate's ONE reserved authority ([`crate::reserved`]) — so the diff of
//! THAT pair is the engine's TRANSFER decision surface; producing it reads no
//! content beyond what a manifest already holds.
//!
//! The RAW diff of [`remote_manifest`]/[`remote_destination_manifest`] is NOT
//! that surface. `apply` strips reserved paths BEFORE diffing (a stranded
//! destination `.sync-aside` is `residue`, never `Extraneous`; a source-side
//! one is a `ReservedName` conflict, never `Missing`), and it derives those,
//! plus the unsupported-destination preflight, from the RAW manifests. A
//! consumer that builds a status on the raw primitives MUST call
//! [`apply_manifests`] (and reproduce the extra decisions) or it risks
//! deleting a stranded original or writing into the crate's reserved
//! namespace.
