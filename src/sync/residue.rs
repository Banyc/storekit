//! Recovery and explicit discard for a STRANDED claim-aside.
//!
//! A sync that replaces an entry whose KIND changed first RENAMES the original
//! aside to a hidden sibling (`.sync-aside.<pid>.<n>`), installs the new entry
//! at the real name, and only then deletes the aside. A process KILLED between
//! the rename and the delete leaves the aside behind holding the ORIGINAL — the
//! pre-replace state. [`SyncReport::residue`](crate::sync::SyncReport::residue)
//! detects the strand and reports it; the sync itself never removes it (its
//! removal of a destination-only directory holding residue is refused as
//! [`ConflictReason::ResidueBelow`](crate::sync::ConflictReason::ResidueBelow)).
//!
//! What was MISSING was a way to put the original back. The old documentation
//! told the caller to remove each reported path — which DESTROYS the caller's
//! only copy. This module is the pair of deliberate operations the recovery
//! recipe actually needs:
//!
//! * [`Residue::recover_to`] RENAMES the stranded aside back to the path it
//!   belongs at;
//! * [`Residue::discard`] REMOVES it, explicitly, for the case where the caller
//!   has decided the strand is disposable.
//!
//! # Why a handle, and why `recover_to` takes a target
//!
//! The pair shares ONE precondition (the path really is a stranded residue) and
//! ONE subject (the aside), and the two operations are exactly the two
//! decisions a caller can make about it; exposing them as methods on a
//! [`Residue`] makes "I have identified a strand" a state the caller cannot
//! forget to re-establish before acting. The construction is fallible
//! ([`Residue::detect`]), so a caller cannot recover or discard a path that is
//! not a residue.
//!
//! `recover_to` takes the TARGET path rather than deriving it, because the
//! aside spelling deliberately carries only the process id and a counter
//! (`.sync-aside.<pid>.<n>`) — it never encodes the name it was claimed from.
//! That is not an oversight: embedding the original name would push the aside
//! over `NAME_MAX` for an original at the manifest's legal maximum. The caller
//! knows the original name from [`SyncError::restore_failures`](crate::sync::SyncError)
//! (whose message names both spellings) or from the source tree it was
//! restoring.
//!
//! # Fail closed
//!
//! [`Residue::recover_to`] REFUSES when the target path is already occupied.
//! That is the ambiguous case: the entry at the target may itself hold data
//! (the install may have landed before the crash, or a foreign writer may have
//! created something there), so overwriting it silently could lose THAT data.
//! The refusal leaves the aside and the target BOTH intact and names them; the
//! caller must then decide which of the two is the state it wants — inspect
//! them, keep the target and [`Residue::discard`] the aside, or move the target
//! out of the way itself and retry. The crate never makes that decision for the
//! caller.
//!
//! The check-then-rename window is closed against a COOPERATING writer because
//! [`Residue::recover_to`] takes the destination's operation lock
//! ([`crate::sync::destination_lock_path`], through the SAME
//! [`crate::lock::FileLock`] authority a sync run holds for its whole duration)
//! for the duration of the recovery; a live holder is the typed contention
//! refusal. A NON-cooperating writer is outside the crate's exclusion, exactly
//! as it is for every other sync mutation (see [`crate::sync`]'s lock
//! discipline). The rename is made DURABLE by fsyncing the parent directory
//! after it lands.
