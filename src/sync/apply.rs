//! Policy-driven transfer of the entries a [`TreeDiff`] says differ.
//!
//! [`sync`] describes both sides as manifests, diffs them, and then moves the
//! `Missing` and `Changed` entries in the caller's [`Direction`] under the
//! caller's [`Policy`]:
//!
//! * only `Missing` and `Changed` entries are eligible — `Same` entries are
//!   skipped with no content I/O, and `Extraneous` (destination-only) entries
//!   are REPORTED and never deleted unless the caller passes
//!   [`Extraneous::Delete`] (the default is [`Extraneous::Keep`]);
//! * [`EntryPolicy::Replace`] overwrites the destination entry,
//!   [`EntryPolicy::Refuse`] leaves it alone and reports a conflict, and
//!   [`EntryPolicy::AppendTail`] applies the append-only prefix rule (below);
//! * directories are created before their children (the diff is path-ordered,
//!   and a parent path is a proper prefix so it sorts first); modes and
//!   symlinks are transferred faithfully; a symlink is never followed;
//! * BOTH directions write a regular file ATOMICALLY and DURABLY. A PULL
//!   writes through this crate's durable, fd-confined primitive
//!   ([`crate::atomic::write_atomic_replace_fd`]) so an interrupted pull cannot
//!   leave a torn entry; a PUSH into a LOCAL destination
//!   ([`crate::transport::LocalTransport`]) routes through the SAME primitive,
//!   and a PUSH into a REMOTE one through the far-side temp-and-rename the SSH
//!   transport emits, so an interrupted push cannot destroy the previous
//!   snapshot either. The exact discipline, by direction and destination kind,
//!   is stated in [`crate::manifest`]'s "Durability and atomicity of a written
//!   entry". A directory and a symlink are still created through
//!   [`Remote::create_dir_all`] / [`Remote::symlink`] and modes through
//!   [`Remote::set_mode`];
//! * after applying, every written entry is re-read and its hash, its symlink
//!   target, and the MODE of every path this sync touched are checked against
//!   the source — a mismatch is an ERROR, never a silent success.
//!
//! # The destruction invariant
//!
//! > A path may be destroyed only when the sync holds an explicit sanction for
//! > that path; every conflict that leaves a path alone also forbids destroying
//! > it, derived from ONE definition rather than a parallel set; and a path left
//! > in place is restored, never mistaken for a path that is gone.
//!
//! Each clause is structural:
//!
//! * **One definition of the prohibition.** A conflict does not need a
//!   separately-populated `blocked` set: the conflict VALUE carries the
//!   prohibition. [`ConflictReason::forbids_destruction`] is an EXHAUSTIVE
//!   match, so adding a conflict reason fails to compile until its author
//!   decides whether the path it names is off-limits to destruction. The
//!   prohibition is then DERIVED from the conflict record at the point of use
//!   ([`Applier::is_prohibited`]), so a conflict site cannot forget to block:
//!   there is nothing separate to forget. This is what covers every
//!   `AppendNotAFile` arm uniformly — a source file, directory, OR symlink over
//!   a destination directory is forbidden, not only the two arms that used to
//!   remember to insert into the set.
//! * **Proof-carrying deletion.** [`Applier::remove_subtree`] requires a
//!   [`Sanction`], not an ancestry question. [`Sanction::ExtraneousFlag`] is the
//!   caller's [`Extraneous::Delete`], and it refuses any path the conflict-derived
//!   prohibition covers; [`Sanction::OwnClaim`] carries the [`Claim`] naming the
//!   aside this sync itself renamed away, so the sync's own cleanup cannot
//!   strand residue under a conflicted writable ancestor — but the claim is
//!   re-established against the LIVE listing before a directory under it is
//!   destroyed, because a child a concurrent writer added after the claim was
//!   taken is NOT the sync's to destroy; [`Sanction::OwnPartial`] carries that
//!   same [`Claim`] for the sync's own rollback creation, so it rests on the same
//!   proof and is subject to the same total live re-establishment. A live entry
//!   that NO manifest spelling addresses is preserved and NAMED under EVERY
//!   variant: the decision is made at ONE authority
//!   ([`Applier::live_entry_manifest_spelling`]), which returns the manifest
//!   spelling a live path must have, so no variant can carry an unconditional
//!   `true`.
//! * **The live kind selects the mutation.** A kind OBSERVED at an earlier
//!   moment — in a manifest snapshot, a [`Claim`], or the mode journal — is
//!   never used to choose a mutation primitive that can destroy a live entry.
//!   [`Applier::remove_subtree`] takes NO kind and reads it from the live
//!   destination at its own entry, so its `Dir` arm (the ONLY place the
//!   per-child authority runs) cannot be bypassed by a caller presenting a
//!   stale non-`Dir` kind; [`Claim`] stores no kind; `transfer_file`,
//!   `append_tail`, and `make_overwritable` route on a live probe
//!   ([`Applier::live_dest_kind`]); and [`Applier::restore`] reads the live kind
//!   and REFUSES (and names) a kind the journal never recorded rather than
//!   applying a mode to it. `transfer_dir` and `transfer_symlink` still choose
//!   the ROUTE (a mode-only change over a directory, versus a claim+create)
//!   from the snapshot, but that choice cannot select a destruction primitive:
//!   the claim carries no kind, the removal re-reads the live kind, and a
//!   snapshot `Dir` whose live object is not a directory takes the mode-only
//!   route where the live guards refuse the chmod/install.
//! * **The final directory removal is NON-RECURSIVE.** `remove_subtree`'s `Dir`
//!   arm removes every child it enumerated through the live authority and THEN
//!   removes the directory itself with `rmdir` semantics (a descriptor-relative
//!   `unlinkat(AT_REMOVEDIR)` locally, `rmdir` through the exec seam remotely),
//!   which fails LOUDLY when the directory is not empty. A non-reserved entry a
//!   writer creates after the last enumeration is therefore REFUSED and NAMED,
//!   never destroyed unnamed, so the walk's claim — everything under this
//!   directory was enumerated and sanctioned — is re-established by the
//!   filesystem AT THE MOMENT OF REMOVAL. There is no recursive removal
//!   primitive at all: the walk of a directory's children is iterative (an
//!   explicit heap stack, one frame per directory), and every child is
//!   re-checked against the live authority on the way in, so a deep tree is
//!   bounded by memory rather than by the thread stack.
//! * **"Left in place" is a state, not `removed`.** A path that becomes residue
//!   is recorded `abandoned` in the mode journal: it is NOT deleted, NOT
//!   transferred, REPORTED in [`SyncReport::residue`], and — because it still
//!   exists — its transient widen is STILL restored. A path this sync removed is
//!   `removed`: there is no mode left to restore and it is never residue.
//!   Conflating the two silently left a widened residue directory at its
//!   widened mode.
//!
//! # The mode-record invariant
//!
//! Installing a child into a read-only destination directory requires
//! transiently widening that directory: creating, replacing, or unlinking an
//! entry inside a directory needs owner write permission on it, and a local
//! durable write additionally chmods the immediate parent private. The whole
//! mechanism is one `ModeJournal`, and it enforces exactly:
//!
//! > Every mode the sync changes is recorded ONCE, with its original value, at
//! > the single place that changes it; every recorded path is restored unless
//! > its final intended mode was successfully applied; and the report is
//! > derived from that record, never from bookkeeping that has been drained or
//! > overwritten.
//!
//! Each clause is realized structurally, not by convention:
//!
//! * **One entry per live path.** `ModeJournal` is a `BTreeMap<path,
//!   ModeEntry>`. `original` is recorded on the FIRST touch only and never
//!   overwritten, so the value a restore must return to cannot be lost by a
//!   later widen, and a second touch cannot create a second bookkeeping record
//!   to get out of sync. A path this sync REMOVED ends its identity; if the same
//!   path is created again (a source file or symlink replacing a destination
//!   directory), the record restarts, because the old identity no longer exists
//!   to restore. A SYMLINK has no mode step (its manifest mode is fixed and
//!   never chmodded), so it counts as settled once its target is verified.
//! * **One widen choke point.** `widen_ancestors` (through `widen_dir`) is the
//!   only path that widens a directory, and EVERY mutation kind calls it before
//!   writing into a directory: a directory create, a regular-file write, an
//!   append write, a symlink create, and a removal — which additionally widens
//!   the TARGET of a subtree removal, not only its ancestors. The
//!   decision is read from the directory's CURRENT mode, never the source's and
//!   never a cached "already widened" bit (a directory can need widening again
//!   after `finalize` reinstated a read-only final mode, and the read-only
//!   overwrite widen decides from the live file mode).
//! * **One prohibition.** A path whose OWN entry a conflict left alone is never
//!   widened, created, finalized, or removed, and a child that would need it
//!   widened is reported [`ConflictReason::ParentRefused`]. That set is the
//!   conflict-derived prohibition ([`ConflictReason::forbids_destruction`]), not
//!   a parallel `blocked` set. A no-write transfer (a mode-only change — a
//!   file's, or a directory over an existing directory — or an append whose
//!   source is a prefix of the destination) needs no widen and is therefore not
//!   blocked.
//! * **One restore site.** `settle` calls `restore` on the SUCCESS and the
//!   FAILURE path. `restore` does not drain the journal (the report still
//!   derives from it), skips a path whose own final mode was applied
//!   successfully or that was removed, is idempotent (a path already at its
//!   target is not chmodded again), COUNTS every chmod it performs, and
//!   re-reads the mode it wrote back so a dropped restore is never silent.
//! * **The report is derived.** `transient_dirs` is the journal's set of
//!   widened, not-removed paths; an entry is in `applied` only after its final
//!   mode landed AND EVERY verification check passed — content/target AND mode;
//!   `skipped` omits every path the journal touched. No field is accumulated by
//!   a parallel pass that could be drained or overwritten.
//!
//! ## Failure accounting: attempt-first, and the report partition
//!
//! A destination mutation is recorded as an ATTEMPT BEFORE the fallible call
//! runs: `begin_mutation` counts the transfer and names the path, and
//! `commit_mutation` clears the name once the call reports `Ok`. A call that
//! fails AFTER publishing its effect — a write whose bytes are visible while
//! its chmod/fsync/durability check fails (`ReplacedDurabilityUnknown`), a
//! `create_dir_all` that created the directory and then failed, a chmod whose
//! result is unconfirmed — is therefore never invisible: the path it may have
//! changed is named in [`SyncReport::indeterminate`] and its step is counted in
//! `transfers`. This is what keeps `transfers == 0` a valid "nothing was
//! mutated" oracle; the old order (count only after `Ok`) let a
//! partially-applied mutation leave no trace at all.
//!
//! The name is cleared only by a LATER successful call OF THE SAME KIND. A
//! successful chmod (the `settle` restore re-establishing a widened mode)
//! resolves a pending MODE attempt, because the path's mode is then known again;
//! it never resolves a pending CONTENT attempt, because whether a failed write,
//! create, rename, or removal landed is a separate fact a mode restore cannot
//! establish. A failed content mutation therefore STAYS in `indeterminate` even
//! after its mode has been restored.
//!
//! The report lists PARTITION under ONE explicit precedence, applied in
//! `Applier::derive_report`:
//!
//! > `indeterminate` > `conflicts` > `residue` > `applied` > `skipped` >
//! > `extraneous` > `verify_failures`
//!
//! A path named by a higher list is omitted from every lower one.
//! `indeterminate` is the least certain claim (a failed mutation may or may not
//! have landed), so it subsumes every other; `conflicts` is the caller's
//! decision surface and is never hidden; `residue` still EXISTS and must be
//! recovered by hand, so it wins over the verification bookkeeping in
//! `verify_failures` (whose failure is also carried in
//! `SyncError::restore_failures`); `applied`/`skipped`/`extraneous` describe a
//! known outcome; `verify_failures` is the catch-all for a mutation that did
//! not reach a passed final state. `transient_dirs` is deliberately OUTSIDE the
//! partition: it may share a path with `applied` or `verify_failures` (a
//! widened directory that was also applied, or whose verification failed), but
//! never with `indeterminate`, `conflicts`, `residue`, `skipped`, or
//! `extraneous`.
//!
//! ## Kind-changing replacement, the reserved namespace, and residue
//!
//! When the destination entry has a different KIND than the source — a file
//! over a directory, a symlink over a directory, a directory over a file, or a
//! file or directory over a SYMLINK — the stale entry is CLAIMED by renaming it
//! aside to a hidden sibling whose name starts with `.sync-aside.`, the new
//! entry is installed at the real name, and only then is the aside deleted by
//! the ONE deepest-first, widening removal (`remove_subtree`): a read-only
//! directory nested anywhere in the stale subtree is widened before anything is
//! unlinked from it. Before replacing a destination directory, the sanction
//! check consults the UNSTRIPPED residue set as well as the diff, so a directory
//! whose only child is an aside is never mistaken for an empty one. Same-kind
//! file overwrites are already atomic (temp + rename) and are not claimed.
//!
//! The RESERVED namespace is defined ONCE by [`crate::reserved`] and has TWO
//! families: the `.sync-aside.` claim-aside prefix AND the operation-lock
//! record spelling `.<name>.operation.lock` (the sibling
//! [`destination_lock_path`] derives, the SAME rule [`crate::id::valid_name`]
//! refuses). Reserving the lock spelling is what keeps a nested store's held
//! record — `snapshots/.001.operation.lock`, which lies INSIDE a parent store's
//! judged tree — out of the diff: a sanctioned parent sync must never transfer
//! it and never destroy it, because [`crate::lock::FileLock`]'s STABLE-INODE
//! discipline requires the record to be created once and never removed (a
//! removed record lets two live holders win the same logical lock). Before the
//! diff, every manifest entry with a reserved component is stripped from the
//! SOURCE. On the DESTINATION the strip is NARROWER: a reserved-spelled TEMP —
//! the atomic-replace temp for a destination whose name itself begins
//! `sync-aside.`, `.sync-aside.<name>.tmp.<pid>.<n>`, or the claim temp
//! `.sync-aside.<name>.claim.<pid>.<n>` — is LEFT in the destination manifest,
//! so the diff reports it [`SyncReport::extraneous`] (it holds no original and
//! the documented recovery is a removal of it). Only a reserved entry that is
//! NOT a crate temp ([`crate::atomic::is_crate_temp_name`] = false: a genuine
//! `.sync-aside.<pid>.<n>` claim-aside or a lock record) is stripped as residue.
//! A
//! DESTINATION reserved entry that holds something is abandoned residue: it is
//! reduced to its topmost
//! path in [`SyncReport::residue`], NEVER transferred (a pull must not copy a
//! stranded aside into the other tree), and NEVER removed — not even by
//! [`Extraneous::Delete`]: a destination-only directory that contains residue has
//! its removal refused as [`ConflictReason::ResidueBelow`], and a CLAIMED subtree
//! that contains residue is left in place (the removal stops at the residue
//! child instead of handing the directory to a recursive removal, which
//! would delete exactly the entry that was skipped) — and ALWAYS reported, so the
//! caller can recover it by hand instead of losing it. Residue has a SECOND
//! kind, NOT in the reserved namespace: a live ORDINARY destination path the run
//! refused to remove or displace — a child a concurrent writer added under a
//! subtree the sync was walking under its own claim (no manifest spelling
//! addresses it, so it is not the sync's to destroy), or a writer's live entry
//! at a rollback target (the sync refuses to let a `rename` displace it). Both
//! kinds are the same state and obey the same rules below; the ordinary kind is
//! named under its own spelling rather than reduced to an aside. Every path
//! named in `residue` still EXISTS afterward: a claim that moves a
//! residue-holding subtree re-roots the reported paths to their current location,
//! and because the path still exists a transient widen of it is RESTORED (the
//! journal records it abandoned, not removed). This is made true BY CONSTRUCTION
//! by the final reconciliation (`Applier::reconcile_residue`), which confirms
//! every residue candidate present at report time: a candidate that is gone, or
//! whose presence cannot be confirmed because the probe itself fails, is NOT
//! reported as residue — it is routed to the possibility channel instead.
//!
//! Two rules make the report honest about LOCATION:
//!
//! > the LISTS assert EXISTENCE and contain only CONFIRMED paths; the MESSAGES
//! > describe.
//!
//! `residue` is a LIST: every entry is confirmed present at report time, so no
//! message ever has to guess. The POSSIBILITY channel is the other half and it
//! asserts NOTHING: every claim or rollback RENAME whose landed-or-not could not
//! be confirmed is surfaced UNCONDITIONALLY, whether or not any residue
//! candidate falls under it. Each such move names BOTH possible spellings in
//! `indeterminate` (a list that asserts no location) and in a restore failure
//! explicitly marked unconfirmed. The same read-back governs a rename that
//! REPORTS an error: the entry's actual location is READ BACK (the fd-confined
//! kind primitive locally, the transport's typed metadata remotely) and the
//! aside is named as residue ONLY when the entry is confirmed to be there, so a
//! move that landed and then returned an error names the aside while a move that
//! did not land names nothing residue-ish and a move whose location could not be
//! confirmed names neither path AS RESIDUE. The message rule applies to
//! DELETIONS too: a leftover claim-aside is named as still holding the original
//! only after a read-back CONFIRMS it, so a removal that landed and then
//! reported failure names no path that is gone. A SOURCE entry that
//! collides with the reserved namespace is a [`ConflictReason::ReservedName`]
//! conflict, never a silent skip
//! and never residue: it is not a destination path this sync left in place.
//!
//! ## Unsupported destination entries: delete-sanctioned, never transferred
//!
//! A destination may legitimately hold an entry the manifest model refuses to
//! ACCEPT as a faithful tree member — an absolute symlink, an escaping
//! symlink, or a hard link (see
//! [`crate::manifest::canonicalize_tree_destination`]). Such an entry is
//! recorded in the DESTINATION manifest (under its live kind) and named in
//! `DestinationTree::unsupported`, so the diff can classify it rather than the
//! run dying at destination-manifest time. When the source does not hold that
//! path it is an ordinary destination-only entry: it is reported in
//! [`SyncReport::extraneous`] and, under [`Extraneous::Delete`], removed
//! through the SAME live-kind, fold-aware, non-recursive walk as any other
//! (so the pre-fix "one unsupported entry blocks the whole run, including its
//! own sanctioned deletion" is gone). When the SOURCE DOES hold that path the
//! run is REFUSED before any mutation: the entry cannot be replaced in place
//! without destroying or aliasing data the manifest cannot describe, and the
//! error names the path, the reason, and the remedy. A tolerated destination
//! entry is therefore never silently transferred, aliased, or destroyed
//! WITHOUT a sanction. An unrepresentable SOURCE entry is unaffected: the
//! source manifest is always built strictly, so it still fails the run (the
//! address-fidelity guarantee).
//!
//! ## Refusal: transfer versus destruction
//!
//! A path whose own entry a conflict left alone is off-limits to DESTRUCTION:
//! the prohibition is derived from the conflict record
//! ([`ConflictReason::forbids_destruction`]), NEVER from a parallel set, so
//! [`Applier::remove_extraneous`] refuses to delete that path or any entry under
//! it — independent of the directory's mode — and reports
//! [`ConflictReason::ParentRefused`]. The same prohibition refuses a deletion
//! attempted under [`Sanction::ExtraneousFlag`]. The TRANSFER rule is narrower:
//! a refused but WRITABLE existing directory may still admit a transferred
//! child, because that writes a source entry rather than destroying a
//! destination one.
//!
//! Deletion is therefore proof-carrying. The sync's OWN claim aside is deleted
//! under [`Sanction::OwnClaim`] — the caller holds the [`Claim`] naming it — and
//! its own partial creation during a rollback under [`Sanction::OwnPartial`],
//! which carries that same [`Claim`]; neither names caller data, so neither
//! consults the prohibition. Both are still re-established against the LIVE
//! listing at ONE authority ([`Applier::live_entry_manifest_spelling`]): a live
//! entry no manifest spelling addresses is preserved and reported, never
//! recursively destroyed. This is what
//! lets a legitimately admitted transfer clean up after itself instead of
//! stranding residue under a conflicted writable ancestor.
//!
//! What each failure leaves behind:
//!
//! * install fails and the rollback rename succeeds — the destination is
//!   BYTE-IDENTICAL (`canonicalize_tree` equal) and no aside remains. A LOCAL
//!   install goes through `crate::atomic::write_atomic_replace_fd`, which
//!   unlinks its dot-prefixed temp on EVERY failure path, so a failed local
//!   install leaves NO stray entry either: the destination is byte-identical,
//!   not merely aside-free;
//! * install fails and the rollback ALSO fails — including a `create_dir_all`
//!   that created the directory and then failed, where the sync first removes
//!   its OWN partial creation — the destination may hold a stranded aside:
//!   reported in [`SyncError::restore_failures`], and in
//!   [`SyncReport::residue`] when the read-back CONFIRMS it is still there (a
//!   probe that itself fails routes the aside to the possibility channel
//!   instead, exactly as for a leftover aside above);
//! * install succeeds but deleting the aside fails — the destination is
//!   CORRECT (the entry is verified and reported `applied`), and the removal
//!   failure is READ BACK before anything is named. The aside is `residue` only
//!   when it is CONFIRMED present — the removal stopped at a reserved child, so
//!   the holding directory is KNOWN to remain, or the failed call did not unlink
//!   the aside; a removal that LANDED and then reported failure leaves the path
//!   in `indeterminate` and names NO aside that is gone; and a probe that itself
//!   fails records the candidate for the report-time reconciliation rather than
//!   asserting existence. The message describes only what the read-back
//!   CONFIRMED: a present FILE or SYMLINK aside IS the claimed original, so it
//!   still holds it, but a present DIRECTORY aside is confirmed only to EXIST —
//!   `drop_claim` may already have unlinked some of its children before a later
//!   removal failed — so the message says it remains without claiming its
//!   content is intact;
//! * a claim (or rollback) rename REPORTS failure — the entry's actual location
//!   is read back before anything is recorded. A LANDED claim names the aside as
//!   residue and as a restore failure (the caller's only copy is there); a
//!   LANDED rollback re-roots any residue and reports NO stranded aside (the
//!   entry is back at its real path); a rollback that did NOT land records the
//!   aside as residue and as a restore failure; and a location that cannot be
//!   confirmed names neither path AS RESIDUE — instead a restore failure names
//!   BOTH possible spellings and says the location could not be confirmed. The
//!   attempted rename is always counted and, because whether it landed is a
//!   separate fact a mode restore cannot settle, left in `indeterminate`.
//!
//! ## Ordering
//!
//! `transfer` → `finalize` → `verify` (content, targets, final modes) →
//! `remove_extraneous` → `settle` (`restore`, then the mode verification that
//! includes the restored modes). Transfers and verification therefore complete
//! before any extraneous removal, so a sync that fails DURING transfer or
//! verification destroys nothing (the removal phase has not begun): a removal
//! runs only after every write and every final mode has been checked, and a
//! kind-changing replacement claims rather than removes. The one exception is a
//! SANCTIONED removal that fails part-way (a read-only destination root, below):
//! entries the caller asked to delete may already be unlinked, which is why the
//! invariant is stated over UNSANCTIONED entries. The removals' own parent
//! widenings are reverted by the single `settle`.
//!
//! ## The two roots must be disjoint (overlap refusal)
//!
//! [`sync`] refuses a local/remote root pair where one is a STRICT ANCESTOR of
//! the other, before any mutation. Nested roots put the run on both sides of an
//! overlap: a `dst` inside `src` makes the destination manifest enumerate the
//! source's own subtree (the run copies `sub/x` to `sub/sub/x` and, with
//! [`Extraneous::Delete`], destroys `sub/x`), and an `src` inside `dst` makes the
//! destination manifest enumerate the source (an extraneous removal destroys
//! it). Equal roots are ALLOWED: the manifests are identical, the diff is
//! empty, and the run is an idempotent no-op — refusing them would break a
//! legitimate call, so the equality case is carved out of the rule. The rule
//! itself is NOT a second comparison: it is `crate::root::roots_overlap`, the
//! single authority [`crate::root::OwnedRoot::parse`] uses, applied to the
//! CANONICAL roots (trailing separators, `..`, and symlinked components
//! resolved; a not-yet-created destination canonicalized up to its longest
//! existing prefix). The refusal is an error naming BOTH roots.
//!
//! UNDECIDABLE CASE: when `remote.is_local()` is false the remote root names a
//! path on ANOTHER host, which this host cannot resolve — the far-side path may
//! coincide with, contain, or be contained by the local root (a bind mount, a
//! shared filesystem, or an `ssh` target that is this very host). NO refusal is
//! computed there, and none is implied: the two roots are NOT guaranteed
//! disjoint, whichever side the unresolvable root is on — a PUSH into a
//! far-side destination that nests the source, or a PULL from a far-side source
//! that contains the local destination — and a caller that co-locates them on
//! one filesystem must enforce disjointness itself. This is stated rather than papered over: the
//! guarantee this module computes is exactly the one it can see from here.
//!
//! ## The lock discipline: the destination is exclusively owned
//!
//! [`sync`] holds the destination's operation lock for the WHOLE run: the lock
//! is TAKEN by [`DestinationOwnership::lock`] (the unforgeable acquiring
//! constructor) before the destination manifest is read, carried in the
//! [`DestinationOwnership::Locked`] token `sync` consumes, and released only
//! after the transfers, the post-transfer verification, and any removal
//! phase. The lock is a [`crate::lock::FileLock`]: an advisory `flock`
//! (`LockFileEx` on Windows) held by an open descriptor, which the kernel
//! releases when the descriptor drops. The guard is therefore released on the
//! success path, on EVERY error return, and on a panic that unwinds; a
//! `SIGKILL`ed holder releases it too, because the kernel closes the process's
//! descriptors. There is ONE authority for how a lock is taken —
//! [`crate::lock::FileLock`], the same primitive the crate documents for its
//! push and checkpoint pipelines — and the record reuses the crate's reserved
//! `operation.lock` FILE NAME. That is a NAME, not the same file: the sibling
//! record and the in-root [`crate::transport::Layout::lock`] are DIFFERENT
//! files that do NOT exclude each other on their own. A caller that needs BOTH
//! records held asks for it by name with
//! [`DestinationOwnership::lock_with_in_root_lock`], which acquires the sibling
//! record then the caller's in-root record in that ONE order (see
//! [`destination_lock_path`] and "Why the lock record is a SIBLING of the
//! destination root"); the plain [`DestinationOwnership::lock`] is unchanged
//! and takes the sibling record alone.
//!
//! ### The conditions the crate ENFORCES (and what a caller still owes)
//!
//! The crate does not trust these conditions to documentation; it builds them
//! into the entry points and into the run itself.
//!
//! 0. **The transport has prepared its own host identity.** Every entry point
//!    calls [`Remote::prepare_identity`] BEFORE the first remote request of
//!    the run and BEFORE the destination lock record is created. For
//!    [`crate::transport::SshTransport`] that creates the local
//!    control-socket directory and pins the verified host key; without it the
//!    documented API was unusable and the first remote request failed with a
//!    misleading "host identity is not configured" (the identity WAS
//!    configured, it had simply not been prepared). The default is a no-op and
//!    [`crate::transport::LocalTransport`] does not override it, so a local
//!    destination is unaffected. The crate discharges the PREPARATION; the
//!    caller still owes the identity MATERIAL — a `known_hosts` path or a
//!    pre-verified `host_key_fingerprint` supplied at construction — because a
//!    crate that invented one would be trusting on first use, which this
//!    crate refuses.
//! 1. **The destination is exclusively owned. The crate enforces this by
//!    TAKING the lock in the acquiring constructor.** The ONE entry point
//!    [`sync`] acquires the destination's operation lock BEFORE reading the
//!    destination manifest and holds it for the WHOLE run: for a LOCAL
//!    destination, a [`crate::lock::FileLock`] on the record named by
//!    [`destination_lock_path`], through [`DestinationOwnership::lock`]; for a
//!    REMOTE destination, the SAME record held on the far side by a persistent
//!    lock session, through [`DestinationOwnership::lock_remote`]. A
//!    cooperating writer that tries to acquire the same record while the run
//!    holds it is refused at acquisition (both acquisitions are non-blocking),
//!    so the run's writes and reads cannot be interleaved by one. A caller whose
//!    own writer holds the destination's in-root
//!    [`crate::transport::Layout::lock`] needs BOTH records held, and asks for
//!    that by name with [`DestinationOwnership::lock_with_in_root_lock`]: it
//!    takes the sibling record and then the caller's in-root record (in that
//!    canonical order) and holds both for the whole run. A destination
//!    the crate CANNOT lock — one with no sibling record location, or a
//!    transport that does not implement far-side locking — is REFUSED by the
//!    acquiring constructor rather than silently run unowned. A caller that
//!    holds such a destination itself must say so by passing
//!    [`DestinationOwnership::Unowned`] to [`sync`]: the VALUE at the call site
//!    is the only place the weaker choice appears, so it cannot be made by
//!    omission.
//! 2. **The source is quiescent. The crate cannot lock the source, so it
//!    VERIFIES it instead.** The source is a remote tree the crate does not own
//!    (a PULL) or the caller's local tree (a PUSH), and there is no lock record
//!    for it. The run therefore re-reads the source manifest after the transfer
//!    and compares it to the one the plan was made against: an entry that ADDED,
//!    DISAPPEARED, or CHANGED makes the run FAIL CLOSED and is NAMED, and a
//!    source read that cannot be repeated is likewise a failure. What a caller still owes is honesty about
//!    ABA: a source that changes and changes BACK between the two reads is
//!    indistinguishable from a stable one — two samples can refute quiescence,
//!    never prove it.
//! 3. **A writer using a DIFFERENT version of this tool, or a different tool
//!    sharing the store, is a NON-COOPERATING writer unless it takes the same
//!    lock.** The ownership claim is only as strong as the ecosystem's
//!    discipline; the crate cannot force another program to take the record.
//!
//! ### What happens when a non-cooperating writer violates the ownership condition
//!
//! A COOPERATING writer cannot interleave: the crate holds the lock, so the
//! writer is refused when it tries to take the same record. A NON-cooperating
//! writer — one that does not take the lock, which includes a writer using a
//! different version of this tool or a different tool sharing the store —
//! still can, and the answer is DETECTION THAT FAILS CLOSED, never permission
//! to lose its data. The post-transfer verification is retained UNCHANGED: it
//! reads every written entry, the touched directories' live listings, and the
//! entries the run claims to have left alone, and surfaces a violation as a
//! conflict, a [`SyncReport::verify_failures`] entry, or a hard error naming
//! the unplanned path. An out-of-band write the verification OBSERVES is
//! therefore reported and the run does not return a clean `Ok`; taking the lock
//! did not narrow that detection and removed no check. The honest limit is
//! COVERAGE, not intent: the verification is scoped to the paths it reads, so a
//! writer that touches only paths the run never inspects can still escape it,
//! and an `Ok` run is not by itself a claim that the destination is clean.
//!
//! ### The far-side (remote destination) lock session
//!
//! [`destination_lock_path`] is a path SPELLING; the local case opens it with
//! [`crate::lock::FileLock`] (a LOCAL descriptor lock). A destination whose
//! [`Remote::is_local`] is `false` names a far-side tree, so the record lives on
//! the far side and no local descriptor can hold it: the transport's sidecar
//! `flock` is taken INSIDE a single remote command and dies when that command
//! exits, so it serialises one lock-record mutation, not a whole run.
//!
//! [`DestinationOwnership::lock`] therefore REFUSES a remote destination — it is
//! the constructor for a LOCAL record — and gives the caller that error rather
//! than a silent unowned run. A remote destination is owned BY NAME with
//! [`DestinationOwnership::lock_remote`], which holds the destination's
//! operation lock ON THE FAR SIDE for the whole run through a PERSISTENT
//! FAR-SIDE LOCK SESSION ([`crate::transport::FarSideLockSession`]):
//! [`SshTransport`](crate::transport::SshTransport) spawns a long-lived local
//! `ssh` client whose remote `perl` opens the SAME sibling record the local case
//! derives, takes a non-blocking `flock`, records the holder identity, and then
//! blocks until the client's stdin closes. The session guard lives in [`sync`]'s
//! stack frame for the whole run; its `Drop` releases the record on EVERY exit
//! path (an ordinary return, an error return, and a panic unwind), and the
//! kernel releases the `flock` when the holder process dies — so a LOST
//! CONNECTION releases the lock, which is why a far-side lock SERIALISES
//! concurrent runs but is NOT a lease. A run that observes its session dead
//! before returning reports a typed transport failure naming the lost lock,
//! never a clean `Ok`.
//!
//! A caller that does not own the remote destination states that with the
//! [`DestinationOwnership::Unowned`] value, and for that run the crate enforces
//! NEITHER the destination lock NOR any far-side exclusion, so a cooperating
//! far-side writer is not excluded and the caller must supply the serialisation
//! itself. The SOURCE-quiescence re-read still runs in both cases. What REMAINS
//! outside the crate's exclusion even with [`DestinationOwnership::lock_remote`]
//! is a NON-COOPERATING far-side writer that never takes the record.
//!
//! ### Why the lock record is a SIBLING of the destination root
//!
//! The lock record is deliberately NOT placed inside the destination tree.
//! Placing the sync's OWN record in the tree would create the destination ROOT
//! itself for a run that must create nothing, and it would mutate the tree the
//! run reads, destroying the "a fully-refused pull creates NOTHING, not even
//! the root" and "two empty trees are a no-op" contracts (both pinned by
//! tests). [`destination_lock_path`] therefore derives a dot-prefixed sibling
//! record in the destination root's parent: taking the sync's own lock never
//! creates or enters the tree the run is judging. The record reuses the
//! reserved `operation.lock` FILE NAME, not the PATH of
//! [`crate::transport::Layout::lock`].
//!
//! PREMISE CHECK (what actually happens if an in-root record IS taken): an
//! earlier revision of this module claimed an in-root `state/operation.lock`
//! "would enter the destination manifest the run is judging". That is FALSE for
//! the record itself. The destination view strips it as RESIDUE:
//! [`apply_manifests`] strips the destination with
//! [`crate::reserved::is_residue_path`], and a component that is the
//! application-lock spelling (`operation.lock`) is residue, so the record is
//! invisible to the diff, never transferred, and never destroyed. What DOES
//! remain is the record's PARENT directory when the lock creates it: an
//! ordinary empty `state/` is destination-only content, so it appears in the
//! diff; under [`Extraneous::Delete`] its removal is refused because it holds
//! residue, and it is reported as residue rather than destroyed. That is why
//! the COMPOSED form ([`DestinationOwnership::lock_with_in_root_lock`]) still
//! requires the destination root to pre-exist and never creates the root, and
//! why the plain form keeps the sibling location.
//!
//! ### The sibling record and the in-root `Layout::lock`: composed BY NAME
//!
//! [`crate::transport::Layout::empty`]'s `lock` is the IN-ROOT
//! `state/operation.lock` (inside the destination root); this record is
//! `<parent>/.<name>.operation.lock` (outside it). They are DIFFERENT files,
//! so the two locks are INDEPENDENT and do NOT exclude each other in either
//! direction:
//!
//! * a caller holding [`crate::lock::FileLock`] on the in-root layout lock
//!   does NOT stop a plain [`sync`] from taking the sibling record and running;
//! * a plain [`sync`] holding the sibling record does NOT stop a caller from
//!   taking the in-root layout lock.
//!
//! A caller that needs one lock to exclude the other asks for BOTH by name:
//! [`DestinationOwnership::lock_with_in_root_lock`] takes the sibling record
//! and then the caller's in-root record (the CANONICAL ORDER, enforced in the
//! constructor) and holds both for the whole run. A non-cooperating writer
//! that takes neither is still only DETECTED, never excluded (see "The lock
//! discipline").
//!
//! Composing the two is opt-in rather than the default because [`Remote`]
//! exposes no accessor for its [`crate::transport::Layout`]: the applier cannot
//! learn the caller's in-root lock path from a `&dyn Remote`, and assuming the
//! conventional `state/operation.lock` would be wrong for a custom layout. The
//! caller therefore NAMES the record by passing its
//! [`crate::transport::Layout::lock`] path (a [`RootedRelativePath`]) to
//! [`DestinationOwnership::lock_with_in_root_lock`]; the plain
//! [`DestinationOwnership::lock`] keeps the sibling record alone and creates
//! nothing inside the root.
//!
//! Because the record is a SIBLING, placing it can touch a directory OUTSIDE
//! the destination root that the CALLER owns — the root's parent, and any
//! missing ancestor of it. Two things are true of that touch, and they are the
//! contract:
//!
//! * **The parent chain is created at the PLATFORM DEFAULT mode, never the
//!   store-private `0o700`.** The owned entry points pre-create a missing chain
//!   with `create_dir_all` ([`create_lock_parent`]), the same mode the run's own
//!   `root_for_mutation` gives a destination root's missing ancestors, so the
//!   lock path introduces no mode the run would not itself have used. (This is
//!   deliberately NOT a change to [`crate::lock::FileLock`] or
//!   [`crate::atomic::ensure_private_dir_durable`], which serve the transport's
//!   sidecar locks where the private mode IS required.)
//! * **A PULL's DESTINATION TREE is still created lazily and only by a
//!   mutation.** (A PUSH instead PROVISIONS its remote destination root and
//!   the caller's bootstrap directories before the destination manifest is
//!   read — see [`sync`]'s "The destination root" section — which mutates the
//!   destination's ROOT only, never anything inside it.) "A fully-refused pull
//!   creates NOTHING" holds for the root and everything
//!   under it: the record location is outside the root, so the run never
//!   creates the ROOT itself. Three pieces of residue OUTSIDE the root can
//!   outlive a blocked or later-failed run, and all three are named rather
//!   than implied. The first two are created by the lock acquisition itself,
//!   the third strictly earlier; a run refused by the OWNERSHIP check BEFORE
//!   preparation (a remote destination reached through [`sync`]) still creates
//!   nothing at all. This is the honest limit of the contract; it is stated
//!   here rather than implied. The three are:
//!     * the root's PARENT chain, created at the platform default mode by
//!       `create_lock_parent`;
//!     * the persistent sibling record file
//!       `<parent>/.<name>.operation.lock` itself, which
//!       [`crate::lock::FileLock`] creates on first acquisition and NEVER
//!       removes (the STABLE-INODE discipline in [`crate::lock`]) — the same
//!       path the suite pins after a missing-source error
//!       (`an_error_exit_releases_the_destination_lock`); and
//!     * the transport's own PREPARATION residue, created by
//!       [`Remote::prepare_identity`] BEFORE the lock is taken
//!       ([`prepare`]'s refusal -> `prepare_identity` -> lock -> run order),
//!       so a run BLOCKED on the lock, or failing after preparation, has
//!       already created it. There is no cleanup on drop. It comprises the SSH
//!       `ControlMaster` mux directory `<temp_dir>/dmux` (0700), created on
//!       EVERY [`crate::transport::SshTransport`] `prepare_identity` call,
//!       plus the `mux-<hash>` control sockets ssh later creates inside it
//!       (`ControlPath=<temp_dir>/dmux/mux-<hash>`, `ControlMaster=auto`,
//!       `ControlPersist=120`), which the crate never removes; the hash is
//!       keyed on the CONNECTION IDENTITY (`user@host:port` plus the user
//!       key, the resolved known-hosts source, and the caller's ssh
//!       options), so two different identities never share one socket; and,
//!       only when the transport was configured with a `host_key_fingerprint`
//!       and NO explicit `known_hosts`, the managed known-hosts pin — the pin
//!       cache directory (0700, resolved at the transport boundary as
//!       `DEPLOY_SSH_KNOWNHOSTS_DIR` else `<temp_dir>/deploy-ssh-knownhosts`)
//!       and the pinned `knownhosts-<hash>.txt` file (0600), likewise never
//!       removed.
//!
//! The COMPOSED form is the one exception to the plain form's
//! lazily-created-root rule: it requires the destination root to ALREADY EXIST
//! (a typed [`Error::NotFound`] otherwise) and creates at most the caller's
//! in-root record and its missing parent chain INSIDE that existing root, so
//! the composed acquisition itself never creates the destination root.
//!
//! A single-component RELATIVE root resolves through the current directory
//! ([`destination_lock_path`] maps an empty `Path::parent` to `.`), exactly as
//! the rest of the path handling resolves a relative root, so the owned entry
//! points accept a relative destination instead of failing on `mkdir ""`.
//!
//! ## Root pinning, and the race that remains
//!
//! [`sync`] opens the local root descriptor BEFORE it reads either manifest
//! (when the root exists), and every local mutation resolves through that
//! pinned descriptor. The manifest itself is produced by the path-based
//! canonicalizer, so the difference between the descriptor's inode and the
//! path's inode is checked immediately after the walk on Unix: a replaced root
//! is an error, not a diff about one inode and mutations against another. What
//! is NOT guaranteed: an ABA race (the path swapped away and back during the
//! walk) is not detectable by a post-walk identity check, and a swap after the
//! check cannot redirect a mutation (they use the pinned descriptor) but can
//! still make the diff describe the pre-swap tree. Closing those requires
//! descriptor-relative walking, which this module does not have. On Windows
//! there is no directory descriptor, so the pinned-inode check does not exist
//! (the documented weaker guarantee of the Windows port).
//!
//! A PULL's LOCAL destination root is created LAZILY, immediately before the
//! first mutation that needs it, so a pull whose every entry is refused leaves
//! the root ABSENT, not merely empty. (A PUSH does not apply here: it
//! PROVISIONS its remote destination root and the caller's bootstrap
//! directories before reading the destination manifest, so a fresh destination
//! is usable without the caller pre-creating it; see [`sync`]'s "The
//! destination root".) Because the diff of a root that was absent
//! describes the EMPTY tree, a directory that has appeared at the path since is
//! adopted only if it is still EMPTY (exactly what this would have created); a
//! NON-EMPTY one is an error rather than silently ignoring its entries (which
//! would be neither reported nor removed). A narrow race remains between that
//! emptiness check and the mutations — the same pinned-descriptor gap as above.
//!
//! ## Destination-component confinement
//!
//! Every destination mutation consults ONE preflight
//! ([`Applier::guard_destination`]) before it runs: with `lstat` (`kind_opt`,
//! never `stat`/`exists`) it verifies that every STRICT ancestor component of
//! the destination path is a REAL directory (a symlink, a file, or — where the
//! operation requires it — a missing component is refused) and that the FINAL
//! component satisfies what the operation does to it. This is what keeps a
//! destination mutation inside the destination root on a path-based [`Remote`]:
//! without it a symlink at a directory position redirects a write, a chmod, a
//! rename, a removal, or a listing OUTSIDE the root. [`Applier::dir_listing`]
//! additionally refuses to enumerate a path that is not a real directory (only
//! a CONFIRMED absent path enumerates as empty) and carries the live KIND, so a
//! symlink where the manifest says `Dir` is never treated as an intact
//! directory. The preflight duplicates a window a component-confined
//! destination already closes in `crate::atomic` (the platform property is
//! [`crate::atomic::COMPONENT_CONFINED`]; on Unix every `_fd` primitive
//! resolves components with `O_NOFOLLOW`); for a
//! [`LocalTransport`](crate::transport::LocalTransport) the transport itself
//! resolves every non-root path component-wise with `O_NOFOLLOW` (no window) —
//! mutations AND the reads this applier verifies against (`read`, `read_link`,
//! `metadata_opt`, `exists`), so a verification verdict cannot be sourced from
//! outside the pinned root; for an
//! [`SshTransport`](crate::transport::SshTransport) the far-side script cannot
//! be changed, so the preflight is the guarantee and a component SWAPPED
//! between the check and the operation is a residual race — the same class as
//! the root-swap race above, not a guarantee this module claims to close.
//!
//! The applier sees only [`Side::is_confined_local`], a property of the SIDE
//! AND THE PLATFORM it was handed, not of a concrete transport: a
//! [`Side::Remote`] destination may be backed by a
//! [`LocalTransport`](crate::transport::LocalTransport) whose own primitives
//! happen to be fd-confined, but the applier cannot know that, and a
//! [`Side::Local`] destination on a platform whose primitives are path-based is
//! not confined either ([`crate::atomic::COMPONENT_CONFINED`]). It therefore
//! treats every destination whose own primitives are not component-confined as
//! path-based, where the preflight IS the confinement, and caches nothing that
//! would let a repeated probe be skipped (see [`Applier::ancestry_dirs`]).
//!
//! ## The destination root's mode is NOT journalled
//!
//! The widen machinery covers every destination DIRECTORY the manifest
//! describes, but not the destination ROOT: `ancestor_paths` deliberately
//! excludes it ("a manifest does not describe the root"), so neither
//! `widen_ancestors` nor `forbidden_ancestor_blocks_write` reaches it, and
//! `root_for_mutation` creates an absent root without recording or adjusting its
//! mode. A READ-ONLY destination root is therefore NOT transiently widened, and
//! every TOP-LEVEL mutation — a `Missing` file or directory, a `Changed` file or
//! symlink, a top-level removal — fails. The failure is LOUD and never SILENTLY
//! destructive: the attempt is counted in `transfers` and the path is named in
//! [`SyncReport::indeterminate`], and the root keeps its original mode (nothing
//! restores it, because nothing widened it). Two things are NOT claimed here.
//! First, `no entry is destroyed` holds only for UNSANCTIONED entries: a
//! top-level `Changed` or `Missing` mutation fails before it touches any entry,
//! so nothing is mutated at all, but a top-level removal the caller SANCTIONED
//! ([`Extraneous::Delete`] over an extraneous directory) may unlink that
//! directory's children before the removal's own final `rmdir` fails on the
//! read-only root — a sanctioned deletion that stops part-way, not a destroyed
//! caller entry. Second, the sync's own residue cleanup is likewise a sanctioned
//! removal and can fail the same way. This is a deliberate, DOCUMENTED
//! limitation: correcting it would require a root-mode operation on the
//! [`Remote`] transport, and `Remote::root()` is
//! documented to name an entry on a REMOTE
//! host for an [`SshTransport`](crate::transport::SshTransport), so the root
//! cannot be chmodded portably from this module. Widening only the LOCAL
//! destination root would make the guarantee depend on the direction and the
//! transport, so the invariant is stated uniformly: the root is not ours to
//! chmod, and a read-only one fails loudly rather than being repaired.
//!
//! ## Missing ancestors of the destination root are created, not accounted
//!
//! When the destination root is ABSENT, `root_for_mutation` creates it with
//! `std::fs::create_dir_all`, which also creates any MISSING ANCESTOR
//! directories of the root path (OUTSIDE the root itself). What is created:
//! each absent component of the caller-supplied root path, with the
//! platform's default directory mode, at the moment of the FIRST mutation that
//! needs the root. When: LAZILY — a sync whose every entry is refused never
//! calls it, so no root and no ancestor appears — and only ever from inside a
//! mutating primitive that has ALREADY recorded its attempt
//! ([`Applier::begin_mutation`]), so `transfers == 0` still implies nothing was
//! mutated. The creation is NOT journalled, NOT counted in `transfers`, and NOT
//! rolled back if a later step fails. That is safe: the ancestors are neither
//! manifest entries nor caller data (they did not exist), they are the
//! prerequisites of the caller's own requested destination path, and rolling
//! them back would risk deleting a directory a concurrent process has since
//! come to depend on. The root's own mode is likewise not journalled (above).
//!
//! ## Path ancestry
//!
//! Ancestry of a MANIFEST path is always interpreted over the manifest's
//! `/`-separated segments (`manifest_strip_prefix`, `manifest_file_name`,
//! `parent_manifest`, `ancestor_paths`), never by handing the string to the
//! host `std::path::Path` model: on Windows that model treats a literal `\`
//! as a separator and would split one manifest component into two. The
//! manifest model splits on `/` only, so a `\`-bearing name stays whole and a
//! sibling whose name shares a prefix with a directory (`px` beside `p`) is
//! never mistaken for a descendant. Host paths (the roots themselves) are
//! still manipulated with `std::path::Path`, which is the right model for
//! them.
//!
//! ## Manifest paths are addresses
//!
//! A manifest path is used as a filesystem ADDRESS (through [`rooted`]), so the
//! stored spelling must BE the on-disk name. That guarantee belongs to the
//! canonicalizer, not to this module: [`canonicalize_tree`] and
//! [`canonicalize_remote_entries`](crate::manifest::canonicalize_remote_entries)
//! refuse any name that is not already NFC and UTF-8, so a stored path can never
//! be a spelling the filesystem does not contain. This module therefore never
//! re-normalizes a manifest path: on a normalization-sensitive filesystem
//! (Linux/ext4) re-normalizing is exactly how a decomposed on-disk name became a
//! stored spelling with no file behind it — a source read that failed, a second
//! entry written beside the original (a tree that then refuses to canonicalize
//! at all), or an [`Extraneous::Delete`] removal that silently addressed a path that
//! did not exist. Every bookkeeping string this module builds
//! (`manifest_spelling`, `join_manifest_path`, `re_root_path`) is derived from an
//! already-canonical path or from the LIVE directory listing, and the address a
//! removal uses is `RootedRelativePath::join` of the listed name itself, so a
//! bookkeeping conversion is never used as an address.
//!
//! ## The destination filesystem can fold the address anyway
//!
//! A canonical spelling is faithful to the SOURCE filesystem's listing, which
//! says nothing about the DESTINATION's: an aliasing destination — a
//! case-insensitive one (macOS APFS, Linux ext4 with `casefold`) or one that
//! folds any other way — resolves a spelling to a pre-existing,
//! differently-spelled entry. The address then does not name what the sync
//! thinks, and two contracts would break silently: "make the destination match
//! the source" (the on-disk name never changes, so the sync never converges)
//! and "a path may be destroyed only under a sanction FOR THAT PATH" (the
//! [`Extraneous::Delete`] sanction is keyed on a spelling that aliases another
//! file, so the pass destroys the entry just transferred through the fold).
//! Three rules close it, all in this module because only this module knows the
//! destination at run time:
//!
//! * **The installed NAME is verified in the same pass as content and mode.**
//!   [`Applier::verify_names`] reads each installed entry's parent DIRECTORY and
//!   requires a BYTE-IDENTICAL entry; a mismatch is a
//!   [`ConflictReason::NameNotFaithful`] conflict naming the on-disk spelling in
//!   [`Conflict::on_disk`], is never `applied`, and records the on-disk spelling
//!   in [`Applier::aliased_dest`]. Resolving the manifest spelling (`open`/
//!   `stat`) is deliberately NOT used: the filesystem folds it onto the very
//!   entry the check is meant to notice.
//! * **Every TOUCHED directory is verified BYTE-IDENTICALLY, and no install may
//!   land through a fold.** This is the structural backstop, independent of any
//!   fold RULE. Before an install, [`Applier::refuse_address_folded_onto_-
//!   another_name`] asks the destination two exact questions — is the manifest
//!   spelling in its parent's live listing, and does the address nevertheless
//!   RESOLVE? — and refuses when the filesystem folded the spelling onto a
//!   differently-spelled entry. After the transfers, [`Applier::verify_-
//!   directory_listings`] compares the LIVE listing of EVERY directory the run
//!   touched (installed into, created, or removed from) against the names the
//!   run expected there, BYTE-IDENTICALLY, and reports an absent expected name
//!   or an unplanned on-disk name as a [`ConflictReason::NameNotFaithful`]
//!   conflict; [`Applier::verify_claimed_untouched`] re-reads the KIND and
//!   content of the entries the report calls `Skipped` (a fold must not destroy
//!   or kind-swap a victim the run never names). These checks hold for folds [`alias_in`]'s
//!   `to_lowercase` model cannot name (`ß`/`ss`, `ﬁ`/`fi`, `ς`/`σ`), and a fold
//!   in a PARENT component is caught because [`Applier::verify_names`] verifies
//!   EVERY ancestor component against its own parent's live listing, not only
//!   the final one. A source manifest whose path has a parent that is not itself
//!   an entry (`d/x` with no `d`) cannot reach this module at all: the manifest
//!   assemblers ([`canonicalize_tree`] and
//!   [`canonicalize_remote_entries`](crate::manifest::canonicalize_remote_entries))
//!   both enforce parent-closure, and the local walk is closed by construction.
//!   That assembler gate is THE guarantee; the applier does not repeat it,
//!   because every manifest it can be handed has already passed it.
//! * **Removal is identity-aware.** [`Applier::remove_extraneous`] removes a
//!   destination-only entry only when its manifest spelling is present in its
//!   parent's LIVE listing AND no source entry aliases the on-disk spelling; a
//!   spelling that is absent from the listing, or aliased, is a
//!   [`ConflictReason::NameNotFaithful`] conflict and is left in place. This is
//!   what stops [`Extraneous::Delete`] from destroying the entry a fold just
//!   transferred.
//! * **A case pair the destination cannot represent is refused up front.**
//!   [`Applier::refuse_unrepresentable_case_aliases`] groups source entries by
//!   case-folded name and, when a transfer is at stake, ASKS THE DESTINATION
//!   what it is with a probe ([`Applier::dest_case_insensitive`]: create a
//!   unique mixed-case directory in the reserved namespace, look it up with the
//!   case flipped, remove it — a `create_dir_all`, an existence lookup, and a
//!   `remove` on the destination root, at most once per run). On a
//!   case-insensitive destination the member(s) that cannot be represented are
//!   [`ConflictReason::NameNotFaithful`] conflicts; on a case-SENSITIVE
//!   destination the pair is legitimate and transfers normally. This is an
//!   EARLY, cheaper check, not the backstop: a destination whose root is ABSENT
//!   cannot be probed without creating it, and a run that refuses every entry
//!   must not create it, so the pair is conservatively refused WITHOUT probing
//!   (the structural per-directory check still covers whatever transfers).
//!
//! A directory the run cannot ENUMERATE faithfully — the transport's listing
//! refuses a name that is not valid UTF-8 rather than hand out a lossy view —
//! is a directory against which the run cannot verify its OWN result. Such a
//! listing failure is therefore raised ONCE at the run level
//! ([`unenumerable_directory_error`]) and propagates out of
//! [`Applier::verify_names`], [`Applier::verify_directory_listings`],
//! [`Applier::verify_claimed_untouched`], the pre-install fold gate
//! ([`Applier::refuse_address_folded_onto_another_name`]), and
//! [`Applier::remove_extraneous`]; it is never re-classified as a per-path
//! [`ConflictReason::NameNotFaithful`] conflict. No entry in a directory the run
//! could not enumerate is ever removed. The `NameNotFaithful` conflict path is
//! reserved for a fold the run CAN see (the on-disk spelling is nameable) and
//! for an unnameable fold in a directory that WAS enumerated.
//!
//! ## Which fold checks the test suite pins on which platform
//!
//! The fold reproductions in `apply/tests.rs` come in two kinds, and they do
//! NOT have the same platform coverage:
//!
//! * The checks that need only a DIFFERENTLY-SPELLED entry to exist — the
//!   ancestor walk in [`Applier::verify_names`] and the per-directory
//!   byte-exact listing backstop in [`Applier::verify_directory_listings`] —
//!   are exercised on BOTH a case-insensitive and a case-sensitive filesystem:
//!   the writer seam renames (`d` -> `D`) or creates a differently-spelled
//!   entry directly, so the address simply does not name what the manifest
//!   holds. `a_folded_ancestor_after_an_install_is_not_reported_applied` runs
//!   on Linux too.
//! * The checks whose PREMISE is that the destination filesystem RESOLVES a
//!   spelling to a differently-spelled entry — the pre-install fold gate
//!   ([`Applier::refuse_address_folded_onto_another_name`]) and the
//!   identity-aware removal branch ([`Applier::remove_extraneous`]) — are
//!   pinned ONLY on a case-insensitive (or otherwise aliasing) destination.
//!   Their tests skip when `filesystem_is_case_insensitive()` is false, and a
//!   disable-alone run on a case-sensitive Linux/ext4 destination leaves the
//!   suite GREEN: neither check's refusal is exercised there. This is recorded
//!   rather than claimed away. Pinning them on Linux needs a TEST-ONLY aliasing
//!   [`Remote`] wrapper (one that folds names as it stores and lists them so a
//!   manifest spelling resolves to a differently-spelled entry on ext4); none
//!   is present, so the Linux coverage of those two checks is, precisely: not
//!   covered by the reproductions, only on macOS/ext4-with-casefold.
//!
//! # `AppendTail`
//!
//! A manifest carries hashes, not bytes, so the append-only rule reads the
//! bytes of BOTH sides: if the destination is a prefix of the source, the
//! source is written through the durable replace primitive (the same
//! observable result as appending the tail, and it can never truncate); if the
//! source is a prefix of the destination, no bytes are written; otherwise the
//! two DIVERGED — reported as a conflict, never merged and never truncated. A
//! destination that is absent is written whole, INCLUDING a zero-length
//! source. The rule constrains bytes only: when no bytes need writing a
//! differing mode is still applied. It is defined only for regular files:
//! applying it to a directory or a symlink is an
//! [`ConflictReason::AppendNotAFile`] conflict, never a destructive
//! substitute.
//!
//! The crate encodes no application's file names or record kinds: the caller
//! supplies the [`Policy`] keyed on the path and entry kind, and
//! [`ReplaceAll`] is provided as the default "make the destination match the
//! source".

/// dropped xattr or ACL leaves `local_manifest == remote_manifest` true and
/// the run reports no difference. A caller that needs any of them must apply
/// them out of band after the sync.
///
/// A successful `Ok(report)` is NOT by itself a clean-destination claim: the
/// caller must consult the report's lists. In particular
/// [`SyncReport::verify_failures`] can be non-empty on `Ok` (a destination
/// entry the run claimed to leave untouched whose content changed under the

///    [`DestinationOwnership::lock_with_in_root_lock`] for the owned paths,
///    [`sync`] for the unowned path) before the first remote request and before
///    the destination lock record is created. The default
///    is a no-op and [`crate::transport::LocalTransport`] does not override
///    it, so a local destination is unaffected; for
///    [`crate::transport::SshTransport`] this is what creates the
///    control-socket directory and pins the verified host key. The caller
///    still supplies the identity MATERIAL (`known_hosts` or
///    `host_key_fingerprint`) at construction: the crate will not
///    trust-on-first-use.
/// 1. **The destination is exclusively owned, and the crate ENFORCES it by
///    TAKING the lock in the acquiring constructor**
///    ([`DestinationOwnership::lock`], a [`crate::lock::FileLock`] on the
///    record named by [`destination_lock_path`]), before the destination
///    manifest is read; `sync` then holds the resulting token for the whole
///    run, so a cooperating writer is refused at acquisition instead of
///    interleaving. A caller whose own writer holds the destination's in-root
///    [`crate::transport::Layout::lock`] names that record and takes BOTH with
///    [`DestinationOwnership::lock_with_in_root_lock`]. A REMOTE destination is
///    owned instead with [`DestinationOwnership::lock_remote`], which holds the
///    same record on the far side. A destination the crate cannot lock is
///    REFUSED there, not run unowned; only the
///    [`DestinationOwnership::Unowned`] value reaches it.
/// 2. **The source is quiescent, and the crate VERIFIES it.** The source
///    cannot be locked, so the run re-reads its manifest at the end and fails
///    closed, naming the paths that moved, if it differs from the plan.
/// 3. **A writer using a DIFFERENT version of this tool, or a different tool
///    sharing the store, is a NON-COOPERATING writer unless it takes the same
///    lock** — the ownership claim is only as strong as the ecosystem's
///    discipline.
///
/// A non-cooperating writer that writes the destination anyway is still
/// DETECTED and the run still FAILS CLOSED: the post-transfer verification is
/// retained unchanged (detection is scoped to the paths the run reads, so its
/// coverage is not total). For a REMOTE destination,
/// [`DestinationOwnership::lock`] refuses outright and
/// [`DestinationOwnership::lock_remote`] holds the far-side record;
/// [`DestinationOwnership::Unowned`] is the explicitly weaker path, and the
/// module docs ("The lock discipline" and the far-side lock session) state the
/// residual.
///
/// # The two roots must be disjoint
///
/// The local root and the remote root must be DISJOINT: neither may be an
/// ANCESTOR of the other, in either direction. A destination nested inside the
/// source makes the destination manifest enumerate the source's own subtree, so
/// the run copies `sub/x` to `sub/sub/x` and — with [`Extraneous::Delete`] —
/// destroys `sub/x`; a source nested inside the destination makes the
/// destination manifest enumerate the source, so an extraneous removal destroys
/// the source. Either way the run is on both sides of an overlap and no report
/// can be trusted. EQUAL roots are NOT refused: the two manifests are
/// identical, the diff is empty, and the run is an idempotent no-op.
///
/// The refusal happens BEFORE any mutation and names BOTH roots. It reuses the
/// crate's ONE overlap authority ([`crate::root::roots_overlap`], the rule
/// [`crate::root::OwnedRoot::parse`] enforces) applied to the CANONICAL paths,
/// so two spellings of one tree (`..`, a trailing separator, a symlinked
/// component) compare equal and a nested tree compares nested. A destination
/// root that does not exist yet is canonicalized up to its longest existing
/// prefix.
///
/// The check is only computed when `remote.is_local()`: for a
/// remote ([`SshTransport`](crate::transport::SshTransport)) root the far-side
/// path cannot be resolved from this host, so the relationship is UNDECIDABLE
/// here and NO refusal is computed — see the module docs for the residual the
/// caller must cover in that case.
///
/// # Cost of verifying a path (and of a deep chain)
///
/// Verification is PATH-BASED: every manifest path's live ancestry is probed
/// before it is mutated (and its ancestor directories are listed by the
/// name-fidelity pass). For a path of depth D the run performs O(D) ancestry
/// probes and O(D) ancestor-directory listings — `a_deep_chain_costs_linear_
/// ancestry_probes` bounds that COUNT. The count is linear, but the WORK per
/// probe is not, and the two destination kinds pay differently:
///
/// * **A LOCAL path-based destination** resolves the probed prefix
///   component-wise (the preflight IS the confinement there, so no prefix is
///   memoized), so probing the i-th prefix costs i path resolutions and a
///   depth-D path costs O(D^2) path operations. The run pays that PER PATH,
///   which makes the two shapes a checkpoint tool hits different by a whole
///   factor of D. **One changed leaf:** the run probes the D ancestors once, so
///   the OPERATION count is O(D^2); the measured WALL TIME is SUPER-LINEAR with
///   a platform-dependent exponent — ≈2.0 on Linux (99 / 373 / 1472 ms at
///   D = 100 / 200 / 400) and ≈2.5 on macOS (0.64 / 3.44 / 21.2 s; the earlier
///   0.63 / 3.38 / 21.6 s agree), so budget for WORSE than quadratic on macOS.
///   That is the case the deep-chain test bounds, and it is NOT the case
///   a fresh snapshot hits. **A FRESH destination:** all D entries are
///   installed, and EACH install pays its own O(D^2) ancestry probe and listing,
///   so the run is O(D^3) path operations; measured 4.855 s / 41.39 s /
///   582.1 s at D = 100 / 200 / 400 (macOS), ~8.5x / 14x per doubling.
///   `canonicalize_tree` is NOT the cost (it is 2.76 ms / 6.53 ms / 25.4 ms at
///   the same depths); the engine's per-path verification is. A checkpoint tool
///   that creates a FRESH destination per snapshot is therefore CUBIC in depth,
///   not the shape the single-changed-leaf measurement suggested; where it
///   can, it should keep the destination incremental (one changed leaf) rather
///   than recreate it. The bound the deep-chain test pins is the OPERATION
///   count, not this wall time.
/// * **A REMOTE ([`SshTransport`](crate::transport::SshTransport))
///   destination** turns each probe and each listing into exactly ONE ssh
///   round trip: the far side lstat's or lists the WHOLE path in one perl
///   command, so path depth costs bytes on the wire, not extra round trips.
///   A depth-D path therefore costs O(D) ssh round trips — for the same
///   one-changed-leaf chain, 5D+13 metadata probes plus 2D+3 listings (D = 100
///   -> 716 round trips) — and O(D^2) bytes of path spelling. It is NOT O(D^2)
///   round trips. A caller reasoning about a remote transfer should budget
///   ~7 round trips per level of the deepest changed path, plus a constant for
///   the manifest, lock, and verification passes.
///
/// Fixing the local quadratic PER PATH would mean not re-probing a prefix the
/// same operation already confirmed; that is deliberately not done for a
/// path-based destination, where the per-mutation preflight is the confinement
/// and a skipped probe would be an unverified mutation path. It would not by
/// itself fix the fresh-destination CUBIC: that comes from paying the quadratic
/// once per installed path, so the per-path fix is the prerequisite, not the
