//! Regression: a FIFO in a store must not hang the read-side primitives.
//!
//! `path_state_fd`, `read_fd`/`read_json_fd`, `write_atomic_cas_fd`, and
//! `write_atomic_if_match_fd` all used to open the final entry `O_RDONLY`
//! without `O_NONBLOCK`. `open(2)` of a FIFO read-only BLOCKS until a writer
//! appears, so ONE FIFO in a store — from another tool, or an attacker — hung
//! a consumer's verify/recovery and a sync's `AppendTail` compare FOREVER: an
//! unbounded hang on user data. The primitives now open with `O_NONBLOCK` (a
//! no-op for a regular file) and classify the OPENED inode, refusing a
//! FIFO/socket/device with a clear error.
//!
//! The pre-fix failure is a HANG, so an in-process assertion cannot observe it
//! (the test process would block). These tests therefore RE-EXEC this test
//! binary as a child (behind [`MODE_ENV`]) that performs the four probes, and
//! the parent enforces a HARD WALL-CLOCK TIMEOUT: a child that does not finish
//! is KILLED and reported, so the suite itself can never hang.
