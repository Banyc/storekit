//! Advisory locking for push transactions.
//!
//! `FileLock` is an advisory lock held by an open file descriptor — `flock`
//! on Unix, `LockFileEx` on Windows (the platform split lives in the
//! [`unix`] / `windows` submodules behind ONE cfg switch at the module
//! boundary).
//! While the guard is alive the kernel prevents any other process from
//! acquiring the same lock, and the lock is released automatically if the
//! owning process dies — so a stale lock from a crashed controller can never
//! be double-owned, and two live contenders can never both win the
//! acquisition. Locks are taken in a fixed local-then-target order — the
//! application-store `operation.lock` first, then the target lock — so every
//! caller pipeline that touches both, a push or a checkpoint pass alike, runs
//! under the same lock discipline.
//!
//! [`crate::sync`] is deliberately OUTSIDE that discipline: it locks the
//! SIBLING record `<parent>/.<name>.operation.lock`
//! ([`crate::sync::destination_lock_path`]), not this in-root `operation.lock`,
//! so a `sync` and a push/checkpoint pass do NOT exclude each other in either
//! direction.
//!
//! The in-root record's own spelling, `operation.lock`, is the crate's
//! APPLICATION lock record name ([`crate::reserved::APPLICATION_LOCK_NAME`])
//! and is deliberately UNaddressable as an identity: [`crate::id::valid_name`]
//! refuses it (and every case alias of it), so no id the crate accepts can
//! share the name of this record or collide with it on a case-insensitive
//! filesystem.
//!
//! # The STABLE-INODE discipline (why the lock file is never deleted)
//!
//! POSIX `flock` locks are attached to an INODE, not a path. The lock file is
//! created ONCE (on the first acquisition) and is NEVER removed, so every
//! acquisition in the store/session lifetime flocks the SAME inode. Releasing
//! closes the descriptor only (`flock LOCK_UN` + close) — the file itself
//! persists. This is deliberate: an unlock-then-unlink release would open an
//! inode-SPLIT window in which a second process flocks the OLD inode between
//! the unlock and the unlink while a third process creates a NEW inode and
//! flocks that — two processes simultaneously holding "the lock". With a
//! single never-removed inode no such window can exist: a fresh open of the
//! path always finds the same inode, so at most one holder can ever win the
//! flock.
//!
//! # The assumption this guarantee rests on
//!
//! "Stable inode ⇒ at most one holder" is structural only while the record is
//! NOT removed, replaced, or renamed: unlinking the path lets a later
//! acquisition create a DIFFERENT inode and flock that while a live holder
//! still holds the old one — two simultaneous holders. The crate therefore
//! makes the record UNADDRESSABLE through its own substrate: the identifier
//! rule refuses the record spelling ([`crate::reserved::is_unaddressable_name`]),
//! the sync's manifest-path model refuses it at every component
//! ([`crate::reserved::is_unaddressable_path`]), so a whole-store sync can
//! neither transfer it nor destroy it, and every mutating primitive —
//! [`crate::atomic::remove_file_fd`], [`crate::atomic::remove_dir_all_fd`]
//! (including each entry its walk unlinks), [`crate::atomic::write_atomic_replace_fd`],
//! [`crate::atomic::write_atomic_if_match_fd`], [`crate::atomic::write_atomic_cas_fd`],
//! [`crate::atomic::write_file_fd`], and [`crate::atomic::renameat_paths`] —
//! refuses a lock-record spelling ([`crate::reserved::is_lock_record_name`]).
//! HONEST RESIDUAL: a caller that unlinks, replaces, or renames the record with
//! `std::fs`, a foreign tool, or another process acts outside this crate's
//! substrate and is not stopped; the record is unaddressable to this crate, not
//! immovable on the machine. A crash is fine, because the kernel releases the
//! flock and the record persists for the next acquisition.
//!
//! # Contention is TYPED and the lock is NON-BLOCKING
//!
//! Acquisition is deliberately non-blocking (Unix `flock LOCK_NB`, Windows
//! `LockFileEx` with `LOCKFILE_FAIL_IMMEDIATELY`): while another holder is
//! live it fails IMMEDIATELY instead of waiting. The failure is the typed
//! [`crate::error::Error::LockContended`], distinct from a real open/flock
//! failure ([`crate::error::Error::Preflight`]), so a caller's retry policy
//! reacts to the contention class instead of matching the holder message text.

    // the invariant across the interleaving SHAPES of the old delete-window
    // design:
    //
    //   * unlock→unlink               — covered structurally by
    //                                   [release_never_removes_the_lock_file]:
    //                                   a release has NO unlink; the file and
    //                                   its inode persist after every drop.
    //   * unlock→reacquire-on-old-inode — A drops; B and C race to re-lock
    //                                   the SAME persistent inode (schedules
    //                                   1 and 2 order their go-signals); the
    //                                   flock is exclusive, so exactly one
    //                                   wins and the other is refused.
    //   * re-create-new-inode         — a fresh open of the path after the
    //                                   race still yields the ORIGINAL inode
    //                                   (the file was never unlinked); no

    //                                   the lock.
    //
    // The property drives REAL flock operations. Threads of one process that
    // open the same path separately DO contend — flock locks are attached to
    // open file descriptions, not to processes — so B and C's race is real.
    // Each proptest case draws a schedule (the barrier order that re-enacts
    // one interleaving shape) and asserts:
    //   * exactly ONE contender holds the flock after A's drop (XOR);
    //   * the loser failed with EAGAIN;
    //   * the persistent inode is unchanged, so no split is possible;
    //   * while the winner holds, a fresh acquisition is refused.
