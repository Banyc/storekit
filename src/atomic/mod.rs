//! Durable atomic filesystem I/O for the store.
//!
//! The atomic-replace protocol this module implements is the store's
//! durability machinery: write a UNIQUE temp file in the same directory,
//! chmod it private (0o600) BEFORE it can become visible under its final
//! name, fsync it, rename it into place (atomic on POSIX — a reader never
//! sees a torn record), then fsync the parent directory. The replace has
//! TWO DISTINCT COMMIT POINTS and `write_atomic_replace` reports them
//! EXPLICITLY ([`ReplaceOutcome`]): the RENAME is commit point 1 (the new
//! content becomes VISIBLE under its final name), and the PARENT-DIRECTORY
//! FSYNC is commit point 2 (the rename becomes DURABLE across power loss on Linux;
//! see [`ReplaceOutcome::ReplacedDurable`] for the macOS caveat).
//! A failure before the rename is an `Err` — the OLD content is still
//! visible, and the temp file the replace wrote is UNLINKED before the call
//! returns, so a failed replace leaves no stray TEMP entry. (The durable
//! PARENT CHAIN the replace CREATED when the target's parents were missing
//! is an INTENTIONAL, lasting side effect, not something a failure rolls
//! back: creating it durably is exactly what makes a later rename durable,
//! so only the temp entry is undone.) The best-effort unlink is never
//! silent: if it itself fails, the error carries both the original failure
//! and the cleanup failure. A failure of the parent-directory open/fsync
//! AFTER the rename
//! is [`ReplaceOutcome::ReplacedDurabilityUnknown`] — the NEW content IS
//! visible but its durability is UNCONFIRMED — never a bare `Err` (a bare
//! `Err` would conflate "the rename never happened" with "the rename
//! happened but the durability commit could not be verified"). The
//! durability of these writes is the ordering guarantee the rest of the
//! crate builds on: [`ReplaceOutcome::ReplacedDurable`] means the new bytes
//! are visible AND durable BEFORE the caller proceeds — including every
//! directory the replace CREATED to hold them, whose own entry is fsynced
//! into its parent before the rename — while
//! [`ReplaceOutcome::ReplacedDurabilityUnknown`] tells the caller the
//! content is visible but its durability is unconfirmed — so a caller's
//! recovery step can always tell "this write committed durably" from "this
//! write is visible but may be lost". The per-operation sequencing on top
//! of these primitives belongs to the caller, not to this module.
//!
//! The helpers here are the shared plumbing — the `pub` free functions this
//! crate exports as its durable-I/O layer:
//! the tri-state existence check (`path_state`), the fail-closed
//! parent-dir fsync (`sync_parent_dir`), unique temp naming
//! (`temp_name_for`), the atomic marker/JSONL rewrites
//! (`write_atomic_replace`, `write_jsonl_atomic`), private permissions
//! (`set_private`), the tree-object directory
//! copy (`copy_dir_recursive_fd` for a root-confined landing, and the
//! deliberately-named, tolerant `copy_tree_verbatim` for a clone that is NOT
//! landing into a store root), and the JSON readers. Two more are the
//! consumer-facing recovery hooks: [`read_root_dir_fd`] enumerates the OWNED
//! ROOT itself (the empty and `.` child spellings are refused, so residue at
//! the root was otherwise unreachable) and [`is_crate_temp_name`] recognises
//! the crate's own crash residue.
//!
//! The `_fd` tree pair a migration onto this crate needs — an arbitrary-path
//! SOURCE copied to a ROOT-CONFINED destination, and the fd-confined tree
//! fsync — is [`copy_dir_recursive_fd`] and [`fsync_tree_recursive_fd`] (both
//! ITERATIVE, and both documenting their deltas from the source tool's
//! originals; see the README's "Design conflicts surfaced by the consumer
//! audit").
//!
//! Parse-sensitive marker reads: a PRESENT-but-malformed marker CONTENT is
//! semantic CORRUPTION and maps to [`Error::integrity`] via
//! `read_json_marker` (the file exists, it is just not a valid marker),
//! while a mechanical filesystem I/O failure (open/read/rename/fsync)
//! stays [`Error::store`] — the class split a caller can always
//! distinguish "this marker is corrupt" from "disk read failed".
//! `read_json` folds both into [`Error::store`], which is correct for
//! its non-marker callers (observed.json, retention-debt.json, tree
//! metadata, ...); callers of `read_json_marker` must still perform
//! their own schema-version check after a successful parse (also
//! [`Error::integrity`]): an unsupported `schema_version` is a
//! marker-format violation, not an I/O failure.
//!
//! # The reserved-spelling guard is STRUCTURAL, not a list of call sites
//!
//! The single-holder guarantee rests on the lock record's inode never
//! changing. Enumeration is the wrong shape — the call sites found by hand each
//! missed one — so the guard is no longer applied by enumeration. The SAME
//! shape now also protects a stranded ORIGINAL (destination residue): a
//! primitive that carried the lock authority and skipped the residue authority
//! destroyed a strand file, so BOTH authorities live behind ONE gate
//! ([`guard::refuse_reserved_mutation`]) that every name-mutating primitive
//! consults, with an explicit [`guard::Sanction`] naming the ONE reserved
//! spelling that may be broken.
//!
//! * the private [`guard`] module owns the ONE reserved-spelling gate (the
//!   lock-record authority AND the residue authority) and the
//!   unforgeable [`GuardedRel`] capability (private fields; `new` and
//!   `new_for_owned_lock_record` are the only constructors and the only
//!   callers of the guard); every rel-path mutator mints one, and the rename
//!   worker demands one;
//! * the low-level single-NAME syscall wrappers in [`unix`] (`unlinkat`,
//!   `renameat`, `symlinkat`, `linkat`, `mkdirat`) and the mutating branch of
//!   [`openat_no_follow_io`] run the guard at the PRIMITIVE, so a new caller
//!   of an existing wrapper is guarded without remembering to be;
//! * the wrappers are private and every direct name-mutating `libc` call in
//!   the crate lives in [`unix`] (the resolved-symbol deny in `clippy.toml`
//!   refuses the funnel's mutation symbols everywhere else, and the source
//!   audits `guard::tests::every_production_libc_reference_is_pinned` and
//!   `guard::tests::std_fs_name_mutation_counts_are_pinned` notice a change),
//!   so a new primitive must either present the capability or fail a device.
//!
//! The honest residual is in [`guard`]'s module docs and [`crate::reserved::is_lock_record_name`].
//!
//! # The platform split (ONE cfg switch at the module boundary)
//!
//! The platform-dependent primitives — private permissions, the atomic
//! replace's rename/fsync semantics, and the owned-root confinement — live
//! in the [`unix`] / `windows` submodules, selected by the TWO `mod`
//! declarations below (the single cfg switch point). [`unix`] provides the
//! descriptor-relative `_fd` implementation (`openat`/`renameat`/`linkat`/
//! `unlinkat`/`mkdirat` with `O_NOFOLLOW` — on that `_fd` surface every
//! PARENT component is refused as a symlink, and the open/create-new helpers
//! refuse the FINAL component too, while the atomic replace installs with
//! `renameat` and replaces the final entry without ever following it; see
//! [`unix`]'s module docs — plus the POSIX parent-directory fsync
//! durability). That component confinement covers the `_fd` surface only:
//! [`unix`]'s PATH-BASED free functions (`set_private`,
//! `write_atomic_replace`, `sync_parent_dir`,
//! `ensure_private_dir_durable`, `copy_tree_verbatim`)
//! take an ordinary path and are NOT covered — see [`unix`]'s module docs for
//! the exact split.
//! `windows` is the path-based implementation with documented weaker
//! guarantees: no directory descriptors (the root is a path), no
//! parent-directory fsync durability, a non-atomic replace (Windows
//! `rename` does not overwrite), and no Unix mode bits. The rest of the
//! crate calls the re-exported surface below and never sees the switch.
//!
//! # The unconfined replace is NAMED, not hidden (API constraint #8, verdict N)
//!
//! The PATH-BASED atomic replace ([`write_atomic_replace`]) takes a raw `&Path`
//! and resolves every component by that path, so an intermediate symlink is
//! FOLLOWED. It is the one UNCONFINED replace, so its name states the weakness
//! and the confined [`write_atomic_replace_fd`] is the form to reach for. It is
//! PUBLIC because it is part of the interface this crate was extracted from (a
//! consumer's port calls the path-based replace; see `docs/CONSISTENCY.md`,
//! axis M) — a public-API name is justified by a CONSUMER's need, never by this
//! crate's own tests. What keeps a raw path out of the DEFAULT is the confined
//! form's SIGNATURE, and that is compile-checked:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! use storekit::atomic::{RootDir, write_atomic_replace_fd};
//! // The confined replace requires a `&RootedRelativePath`; a raw `&Path`
//! // does not coerce to one, so the crate's default mutation cannot be
//! // reached with an unvalidated path.
//! fn confined(root: &RootDir, raw: &std::path::Path) {
//!     let _ = write_atomic_replace_fd(root, raw, b"x", &mut |_| None);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # How the funnel rule is enforced in this module
//!
//! The platform-independent path-based replace here
//! ([`write_atomic_replace`]'s failed-temp cleanup) is one of the funnel's own
//! mutation sites; it consults the reserved-spelling guard through
//! [`guard::refuse_reserved_mutation`]. The module-level
//! `#![allow(clippy::disallowed_methods)]` below lets that call compile while
//! the crate-root `#![deny(clippy::disallowed_methods)]` rejects the same
//! RESOLVED symbols everywhere else. The count PIN in [`guard`]'s tests is a
//! different device: it watches the funnel's own call counts change, inside the
//! allow where the lint is blind. Neither device covers the other.
