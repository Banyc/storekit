//! The Unix implementation of the store atomic I/O: the descriptor-relative
//! owned-root confinement (`openat`/`renameat`/`linkat`/`unlinkat`/`mkdirat`
//! with `O_NOFOLLOW`) plus the POSIX durability protocol (temp fsync, atomic
//! rename, parent-directory fsync). Selected by the single `#[cfg(unix)]`
//! `mod` declaration in [`super`].
//!
//! # Which path SPELLINGS are refused
//!
//! Every path the DESCRIPTOR-RELATIVE (`_fd`) surface resolves arrives as a
//! [`RootedRelativePath`], validated at the boundary: only normal components are
//! admitted, so an ABSOLUTE path (whose `RootDir`/`Prefix` component makes
//! `openat` ignore the root descriptor) and a `..` component (which walks
//! ABOVE the root) are refused as path errors, as are `.` and the empty path
//! (they name the root, not an entry under it). Trailing and repeated
//! separators are NOT refused — [`Path::components`] erases them, so `a/b/`
//! and `a//b` name the same entry as `a/b` and resolve identically. The owned
//! root itself is normalized the same way before it is opened
//! ([`super::normalize_root`]), so `dir/` and `dir` are one root.
//!
//! # Which path components are refused
//!
//! On the DESCRIPTOR-RELATIVE (`_fd`) surface — the one that resolves a
//! root-relative path component-wise against an [`OwnedFd`] for the owned
//! root — every PARENT component is resolved with component-wise
//! `openat(O_NOFOLLOW)` and a symlink there is REFUSED (ELOOP), reads
//! included.
//!
//! NOT COVERED by that component confinement: the module's PATH-BASED free
//! functions take an ordinary [`Path`] and resolve it with
//! `std::fs`/`std::fs::Permissions`, so an INTERMEDIATE symlink in that path
//! IS followed. They are [`set_private`] (crate-internal) and the PUBLIC,
//! deliberately-named [`write_atomic_replace`] (`set_private` serves the
//! unconfined replace) and [`copy_tree_verbatim`], plus the two crate-internal
//! durable helpers [`sync_parent_dir`] and [`ensure_private_dir_durable`]. The
//! component confinement claimed below belongs to the `_fd` surface only, never
//! to these.
//!
//! The `_fd` tree copy [`copy_dir_recursive_fd`] is a PARTIAL exception and
//! is called out here so the list above is not read as exhaustive: it takes an
//! arbitrary, possibly OUT-OF-ROOT source path by design, so its SOURCE side
//! is path-based — the caller's `src` spelling (including any intermediate
//! symlink in it) is followed ONCE when the source directory descriptor is
//! opened, and only the caller's own tree is read. Every entry below it is
//! then reached RELATIVE to that descriptor. Its DESTINATION side is fully
//! component-confined (`O_NOFOLLOW`, `ELOOP` on a symlink in any component).
//!
//! The OPEN / CREATE-NEW helpers — [`openat_no_follow`], [`write_file_fd`],
//! [`write_atomic_cas_fd`] — also open the FINAL component with
//! `O_NOFOLLOW`, so a symlink there is refused too.
//!
//! The atomic REPLACE path — [`write_atomic_replace_fd`] — is the exception.
//! It installs with `renameat` into the descriptor-relative parent, and
//! `renameat` replaces the final directory entry WITHOUT opening it, so
//! there is no final `O_NOFOLLOW` open to raise ELOOP. A final-component
//! symlink is therefore NOT refused; it is REPLACED by a regular file at the
//! link's own in-root path, and the link's former target is left untouched.
//! That is still confinement-safe and race-free (the rename can never follow
//! the link, so it cannot escape the root), but it is "replace, never
//! follow" rather than "refuse". A caller that must REFUSE a foreign final
//! entry instead of overwriting it uses one of the open/create-new helpers
//! above — [`openat_no_follow`], [`write_file_fd`], [`write_atomic_cas_fd`],
//! or the read-side [`read_fd`] / [`path_state_fd`], all of which open the
//! final component with `O_NOFOLLOW` and so genuinely refuse it.
//!
//! # How the funnel rule is enforced here
//!
//! This module IS the guarded name-mutation funnel for Unix: every production
//! `libc` name-mutating syscall the crate issues lives here, together with the
//! path-based `std::fs::rename` of the deliberately-named
//! [`write_atomic_replace`]. The module-level
//! `#![allow(clippy::disallowed_methods)]` below is what lets those calls
//! compile while the crate-root `#![deny(clippy::disallowed_methods)]` rejects
//! the same RESOLVED symbols everywhere else. That lint is the COMPLETENESS
//! device: it matches the symbol the compiler resolved, so no alias, re-export,
//! raw identifier, macro body, `#[path]` relocation, or parenthesized or
//! referenced callee can evade it.
//!
//! The count PIN in [`crate::atomic::guard`]'s tests is a DIFFERENT device with
//! a DIFFERENT job: it notices when THIS module's own call counts change —
//! inside the allow, where the lint is deliberately blind. Neither device
//! covers the other, so both stay.

///   a reserved spelling, the application lock record, a case/trailing-dot
///   alias of either, or one of the crate's own temp shapes) with
///   [`StoreKind::CopyUnlandableName`]. That refusal is CORRECT for a landing.
/// * `copy_tree_verbatim` copies a tree VERBATIM — reserved spellings, the
///   application lock record, and crate-temp shapes included. It exists for
///   the case the landing rule is wrong for: CLONING a live base (a retention
///   checkpoint's copy of a previously-locked store base, which holds
///   `operation.lock` and crash residue) to a path that is **not** a store
///   root.
///
/// # The consequence, stated: the destination is NOT a store root
///
/// A tree this primitive produces can contain names the crate refuses to
/// address, and names its own recovery sweep ([`crate::atomic::is_crate_temp_name`])
/// would REMOVE. A caller must therefore NOT use the destination as a store
/// root, must NOT run the documented recovery sweep over it, and must rename
/// or relocate it before expecting the crate's manifest machinery to accept
/// it. The names are copied because the caller asked for a VERBATIM copy;
/// making them addressable again is the caller's problem, not a silent
/// transformation here.
///
/// # Confinement: none, by design
///
/// `src` and `dst` are ordinary absolute paths. This is the ONE copy that does
/// NOT land into an owned root, so neither side is descriptor-confined and no
/// component is resolved with `O_NOFOLLOW`; an intermediate symlink in either
/// spelling IS followed. What IS refused is OVERLAP: a destination that
/// resolves onto, inside, or above the source is refused with
/// [`StoreKind::CopyOverlap`] (decided from the CANONICAL spellings), because
/// a destination inside the source makes `read_dir` re-yield it and the walk
/// run without bound.
///
/// # What is carried, and what is refused
///
/// * **names, content, kind** — copied byte-for-byte. No name is validated,
///   normalized, or refused for being reserved; a non-UTF-8 name is copied as
///   the platform spelling it is.
/// * **symlinks** — recreated as symlinks (the link DATA is copied verbatim,
///   never followed and never containment-checked). An absolute or escaping
///   target is reproduced exactly: this is not a landing, so the store's
///   symlink rules do not apply.
/// * **modes** — a file takes its source mode EXACTLY (including
///   setuid/setgid/sticky); a directory is created writable for the walk and
///   takes its source mode DEEPEST-FIRST at the end, so a read-only source
///   tree copies cleanly. A PRE-EXISTING destination directory keeps its own
///   mode; a directory this call CREATED takes the source's mode.
/// * **hard links** — REFUSED with [`StoreKind::CopyHardLink`]. The crate
///   refuses hard links by rule, so silently duplicating one into an
///   independent regular file would be the unfaithful choice; reproducing the
///   link (`linkat`) is deliberately not done here.
/// * **special files** (a FIFO, socket, or device) — REFUSED with
///   [`StoreKind::CopySourceNotRegular`]. The source is opened
///   `O_NONBLOCK` and the OPENED inode classified, so a FIFO cannot block the
///   copy. Nothing is SKIPPED: an entry this primitive cannot reproduce
///   faithfully fails the whole copy.
/// * **ownership, xattrs, ACLs, timestamps, file flags, sparseness** — NOT
///   carried (the crate's fidelity scope). The caller restores them.
///
/// # Landing is ALL-OR-NOTHING; the copy is NOT atomic or durable
///
/// Every destination entry is created NEW: a pre-existing file, directory,
/// or symlink at a copied name is REFUSED (
/// `O_EXCL`/`mkdir`/`symlink` `EEXIST`) and left byte-identical. Nothing is
/// ever removed or replaced, so this primitive can never destroy a live entry
/// — in particular it can never split a lock holder. The top-level `dst`
/// directory MAY pre-exist (it is reused); every entry BELOW it must be new.
///
/// There is no temp directory and no final rename, so an error mid-walk leaves
/// a PARTIAL destination tree. Directories this call created are left at their
/// WALK mode (writable) until the final mode pass, so a partial tree is
/// removable; a pre-existing destination directory keeps its own mode. The
/// primitive does not fsync; a caller that needs durability calls
/// [`fsync_tree_recursive_fd`]-style fsyncs itself (it cannot, because the
/// destination is not under an owned root).
///
/// # Source quiescence
///
/// The walk holds no source lock and re-enumerates nothing, so a source that
/// changes shape mid-copy can be copied inconsistently. A caller that cannot

///
/// CONFINEMENT: the destination resolves component-wise from the owned root
/// descriptor with `O_NOFOLLOW`, so a symlink injected into any destination
/// component is REFUSED (ELOOP), never followed — the copy can never be
/// redirected outside the root. The SOURCE spelling is NORMALIZED first
/// (`normalize_root`, the crate's own normalizer: trailing/repeated separators
/// and `.` noise are erased) and its FINAL component must not be a symlink — a
/// trailing separator would otherwise make POSIX resolve the final component as
/// an intermediate one, and `lstat("link/")` would FOLLOW the link the refusal
/// exists to stop. The source is then opened ONCE as a descriptor (the caller's
/// own `src`, deliberately an arbitrary possibly-out-of-root path) and the walk
/// reads it with `fstatat`/`readlinkat`/`openat` RELATIVE to that descriptor,
/// so an INTERMEDIATE symlink in the caller's `src` SPELLING is followed
/// exactly once (a read, never a mutation, confined to the caller's own
/// source). Opening the source entries through the descriptor also means no
/// entry is reached by a path longer than one component, so a deep source tree
/// is not bounded by `PATH_MAX`. The crate's guarded, classified open
/// ([`openat_readable_regular`]) is what reads a regular file: `O_NONBLOCK`
/// plus an `fstat` of the OPENED inode, so a FIFO, socket, or device is
/// REFUSED rather than opened.
///
/// ITERATIVE, NEVER RECURSIVE. The walk keeps an explicit heap `Vec` of open
/// frames instead of one Rust frame per directory level (the source tool's
/// original recursed); a deep tree therefore cannot exhaust the C stack and
/// ABORT the host process. The descriptor bound is ~ONE PER LEVEL of source
/// depth, plus O(1) transient descriptors per destination mutation:
/// `parent_fd_of`/`openat_no_follow` re-resolve the whole ancestor chain, but
/// they do it ONE COMPONENT AT A TIME and drop each intermediate descriptor
/// before the next `openat`, so a mutation holds ONE destination descriptor at
/// the instant of the syscall, never `depth` of them. MEASURED (Linux, depth
/// 256): the copy succeeds at `RLIMIT_NOFILE=262` and fails at 260, i.e. peak
/// ~= depth + 6 — NOT the ~`2 * depth` a first reading of the re-opening might
/// suggest. The bound surfaces as a clean `Err`, never an abort. The COST that
/// does grow with depth is TIME: each destination entry re-resolves its parent
/// chain from the root, so it costs O(depth) `openat` calls (a directory also
/// pays one O(depth) pass in the deepest-first finalize); the source side stays
/// O(1) per entry. This is a deliberate, stated cost, not a hidden one. This is
/// why the re-added form is the iterative one.
///
/// MODE FIDELITY: directory and file modes are copied EXACTLY from the source
/// (including the setuid/setgid/sticky bits — a mode-shifted copy would fail
/// the staged-object digest verification). The walk is TWO-PHASE: every
/// destination directory is created owner-writable and widened during the
/// walk, and every final mode is applied DEEPEST-FIRST at the end, so a
/// READ-ONLY source tree copies cleanly. (The source tool's original created
/// each directory at its final mode before copying into it, so a read-only
/// source directory failed with `EACCES`; keeping the exact final modes while
/// fixing that is a deliberate, documented difference.)
///
/// A FAILED COPY RESTORES EVERY MODE IT CHANGED ([`CopyUndo`], an RAII
/// journal): the widened walk modes are for the walk only, so an error return
/// puts a PRE-EXISTING destination directory back to its original mode and a
/// directory the call CREATED back to the removable `0o700`. A destination
/// that is (or aliases) the source can therefore never be left mutated by a
/// failed copy, and a destination the call CREATED is always removable with
/// the crate's own [`remove_dir_all_fd`] — no `chmod` first. A PRE-EXISTING
/// destination keeps ITS OWN mode (the caller's choice, which the call does not
/// second-guess); a caller merging into a read-only directory owns its
/// removability. On SUCCESS the exact modes are applied and the journal is
/// disarmed.
///
/// FIDELITY IS TO THE MANIFEST MODEL, NOT TO EVERY INODE ATTRIBUTE. The copy
/// carries content, modes (including the special bits), and symlink targets —
/// exactly what [`crate::manifest::canonicalize_tree`] records and the digest
/// covers — so a copied tree is BYTE-FAITHFUL to the manifest model. It does
/// NOT carry mtime, atime, xattrs, ACLs, ownership, or file flags; a caller
/// that needs those (e.g. to preserve a build cache's timestamps) must restore
/// them itself. The cron/manifest of this crate never compares them, so the
/// copy cannot fail a digest check for their absence.
///
/// NAMES: every entry name is validated BEFORE any destination mutation by
/// [`refuse_unlandable_name`], which applies the crate's ONE name authority
/// ([`crate::manifest::validate_entry_path`] — valid UTF-8, already NFC, free
/// of NUL/LF/CR/TAB, within [`NAME_MAX`]) AND the id rule's unaddressability
/// half ([`crate::reserved::is_unaddressable_name`] — reserved spellings, the
/// application lock record, their case/trailing-dot aliases, and the crate's
/// own TEMP shapes). A name the crate would refuse as an id, or strip from a
/// manifest, or that the documented recovery sweep
/// ([`crate::atomic::is_crate_temp_name`]) would REMOVE, is therefore refused
/// instead of landed. The `dst_rel` path itself runs
/// [`refuse_reserved_creation`] before anything is created, so a
/// residue-spelled destination component is refused with NO partial state and
/// with CREATE/COPY wording (never the removal `recover_to` vocabulary).
/// Every destination mutation still runs the ONE guarded gate as well (the
/// directory/file creates and the mutating `openat`), so a lock-record
/// spelling cannot be created by any route.
///
/// THE DESTINATION PATH IS EXEMPT FROM THE RECOVERY SWEEP; A TEMP-SHAPED ENTRY
/// NAME IS NOT. `dst_rel` may itself contain a TEMP-shaped component (the
/// staging shape `deploy` needs, e.g. `.staged.tmp.1.2/root`):
/// [`refuse_reserved_creation`] refuses only RESIDUE spellings (an
/// unaddressable name that is not a crate temp), and the guarded create
/// tolerates a temp spelling because it merely CREATES a fresh entry. The
/// caller must therefore RENAME the finished tree into its real name: a copy
/// left sitting at a temp-shaped destination is matched by the documented
/// recovery sweep ([`crate::atomic::is_crate_temp_name`]) and the WHOLE tree
/// under it is swept. A copied ENTRY name is the opposite: a temp-shaped entry
/// name would be a live file the sweep destroys, so [`refuse_unlandable_name`]
/// REFUSES it. Memory: [`dir_entry_names`] buffers EVERY entry name of a
/// directory into a `Vec` before iterating (measured ~50 B/entry: 200 000
/// entries took 7.86 s in one process and ~13.7 MB), so the walk's peak heap is
/// O(entries) in the widest directory, not O(depth). No cap is imposed: a cap
/// would be an arbitrary refusal of a legal tree, and the cost is linear and
/// freed as each frame drops.
///
/// HARD LINKS are REFUSED (a regular file with `st_nlink > 1`): the crate's
/// own `canonicalize_tree` refuses hard links by rule, so silently
/// duplicating one into an independent regular file would materialize a tree
/// the crate cannot canonicalize. A caller that must copy such a tree
/// pre-checks and dereferences them itself.
///
/// OVERLAP is refused BEFORE anything is created, and the decision is made by
/// directory IDENTITY, not by path spelling ([`refuse_overlapping_copy`]): the
/// source directory and the DESTINATION ANCHOR (the deepest existing directory
/// on `dst_rel`, resolved component-wise from the owned root descriptor) are
/// compared by `(st_dev, st_ino)`, and the call refuses when the anchor is AT OR
/// INSIDE the source (the same directory counts — one term covers it) or when an
/// EXISTING destination is at or above the source. A spelling-based comparison is bypassable
/// by any two spellings `realpath` does not unify — a Linux `mount --bind`
/// alias, a macOS firmlink, a case-fold-equal `dst_rel` on a folding
/// filesystem — and each of those made the destination be created INSIDE the

/// (reproduced: 57 `sub/.../sub` levels to `EMFILE` at `RLIMIT_NOFILE=64` on

///
/// NOT ATOMIC, NOT DURABLE, PARTIAL ON FAILURE: there is no temp directory and

/// [`remove_dir_all_fd`]: the undo journal restores every mode the call changed

/// tree is also never mistakable for a complete one — it is missing entries, so
/// `canonicalize_tree` on it either errors or yields a different digest. Use
/// [`fsync_tree_recursive_fd`] to make a completed copy durable.
///
/// ANCESTORS CREATED FOR `dst_rel` ARE KEPT, and they are the call's own
/// artifacts: they are created at the store-private `0o700` and remain after
/// a failure so the documented cleanup spelling keeps working

/// (non-recursive, so it can never delete a concurrent user's content).

/// SYMLINKS are recreated as symlinks (the link's own target is copied, never
/// followed). The copy is ALL-OR-NOTHING for EVERY kind pair, matching the
/// file (`O_CREAT|O_EXCL`) and directory (`mkdirat`) rules: an entry the copy
/// would land on a PRE-EXISTING destination name is REFUSED and the old entry
/// is left byte-identical. Concretely: file over file / dir / symlink, and
/// dir over file / dir / symlink, are all refused by `O_EXCL`/`mkdirat`; a
/// SYMLINK over file, dir, or symlink is refused by [`symlink_new_fd`]
/// (`symlinkat` `EEXIST`), never by unlinking the old entry. The public
/// [`symlink_fd`] keeps its replace semantics for callers that want them; the
/// copy does not, and there is deliberately NO overwrite FLAG — a copy into a
/// fresh staging path is the documented contract, so an enum choice would only
/// invite a caller to destroy a live entry. The caller is expected to pass a
/// fresh destination (the source tool removes a stale staging directory
/// first).
///
/// SYMLINK CONTAINMENT uses the SAME ONE AUTHORITY as the two manifest views:
/// the copy builds a [`crate::manifest::SymlinkContainmentIndex`] from a
/// filesystem ENUMERATION — the source subtree relocated under `dst_rel`, plus
/// the destination entries the run leaves in place — and runs the indexed rule
/// ([`crate::manifest::check_relative_symlink_target_indexed`]). One rule, one
/// fold, all three views. The destination's existing entries are part of the
/// post-copy view: a destination-only symlink at a component a copied link
/// walks through is REFUSED (the run may not install a link whose kernel
/// resolution leaves the root, even when the escaping component is a
/// destination entry the run did not create). This primitive TOLERATES an
/// existing `dst_rel` DIRECTORY (it reuses and finalizes it, leaving a
/// pre-existing entry's content untouched) but refuses every colliding
/// destination entry (see the SYMLINKS landing rule) and never tolerates a
/// surviving destination symlink on a copied link's path. For the CONTAINMENT
/// verdict a source entry SHADOWS a destination entry at the same path (the
/// source's kind is what the post-copy tree will hold there); the LANDING
/// rules above are separate and refuse a pre-existing destination entry
/// outright. When the source holds no
/// symlink the rule is never consulted and the destination is not enumerated.
/// If a tree cannot be enumerated (a walk or `stat` error), the copy fails
/// CLOSED rather than guessing.
///
/// SOURCE QUIESCENCE: a containment verdict is made from the source's SHAPE
/// enumerated before the walk, and the copy holds no source lock. When the
/// source holds a symlink the copy re-enumerates the source at the end and
/// fails if its shape changed, so a source that moved during the copy is a
/// LOUD error rather than a silent divergence. This is the copy's analogue of
/// `sync`'s end-of-run source re-read. It DETECTS a persistent change; it does
/// NOT close the window between the final check and the `symlinkat` syscalls,
/// so a caller that cannot guarantee a quiescent source must serialize it
/// itself (a lock, or copying from a snapshot) — the crate does not lock an
/// arbitrary source path.
///
/// ERROR CLASSES: the old live `symlink_metadata` probe collapsed EVERY
/// error — ENOENT, ENOTDIR, ELOOP, EACCES, ENAMETOOLONG — into `Absent` ("no
/// symlink here", i.e. ACCEPT), a fail-OPEN arm. The containment index has no
/// error arm: it answers `Absent`/`NotSymlink`/`Symlink` from enumerated
/// entries, so none of those classes can arise INSIDE the rule. They surface
/// in the ENUMERATION and fail CLOSED — the copy refuses rather than guessing
/// a component is absent:
///
/// * `ENOENT`: an entry that vanished between enumeration and the copy is a
///   tree that moved; refused (and the end-of-run source re-check reports a
///   source that changed shape).
/// * `ENOTDIR` / `ELOOP`: a component that is not a directory (or is a symlink
///   loop) cannot be enumerated; refused.
/// * `EACCES`: an unreadable directory cannot be enumerated; refused.
/// * `ENAMETOOLONG`: a spelling too long to enumerate is refused (the fd-based
///   copy walk itself still handles a deep tree; the enumeration is the
///   bound).
///
/// `dst_rel` must not name the destination ROOT itself (an empty path is
/// refused): use [`copy_dir_recursive_fd`] on a non-empty relative path.
/// Ancestors created for `dst_rel` use the store-private `0o700` mode (the
