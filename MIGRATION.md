# Migrating `~/code/deploy` onto `storekit`

The crate was extracted from `deploy`, so the migration is mostly deletion: swap
`deploy`'s copies of the substrate for the crate's, keep everything that is
domain. This file is the ordered checklist and the record of what does NOT map.

**Status: the deploy-side migration is DONE, and this file is its record.**
`deploy`'s substrate now comes from the crate (the last slice was the `id`
newtype machinery). The checklist below is therefore a record of what was done
and why, not a plan — the same convention as `EXTRACTION.md`. Two questions in
it stay OPEN and are marked where they appear: whether `sync` should replace
`deploy`'s own transfer protocol (answered NO for `materialize`, which is
domain), and the receiver-marker adoption, which is done. An earlier version of
this line said "deploy does not depend on the crate yet. Nothing below has been
executed" while sixty lines below it marked steps DONE — the axis-A failure of a
header that was written before the work and never revisited.

## What the migration is not

- **Not a drop-in for `deploy`'s tree transfer.** `deploy`'s push is a domain
  protocol — generations, transactions, the `current` symlink, owner markers —
  and stays in `deploy` (`remote/helper/**`). The crate supplies the transport
  and, where the transfer is a plain tree mirror, the `sync` engine.
- **Not tolerant of what `deploy` tolerates.** The crate's fidelity scope is
  strict and documented: no hard links, no absolute or escaping symlink
  targets, NFC-only names, no CR/LF/TAB. A `deploy` directory holding any of
  those is refused, loudly, rather than carried.

## Order

1. **Freeze the crate.** The API is the target of the migration; land
   `docs/API-CONSTRAINTS.md`'s work first.
2. **Data migration before any push** (see below) — the only step that touches
   existing on-disk state, and the one that fails closed if skipped. **DONE.**
3. **Swap the substrate in dependency order**: `digest`/`platform`/`trace` →
   `atomic` → `lock` → `root`/`owned_root` → `relpath` → `transport` (+ runner,
   ssh) → `manifest`/`canonical`. **DONE** (the final split is recorded below).
4. **Adopt `sync`** only where a transfer is a plain mirror of one tree into
   another. **DONE** for the manifest slice: it is NOT adopted by
   `deploy/remote/canonical/materialize.rs` (see below).

## Module map

| `deploy` | `storekit` | Adaptation |
|---|---|---|
| `store/atomic/{mod,unix,windows}.rs` | `atomic::*` | Every root-relative mutation takes `&RootedRelativePath`, parsed once at the boundary. The path-based helpers `set_private`, `sync_parent_dir`, `ensure_private_dir`, `ensure_private_dir_durable`, `remove_dir_all_path` are gone — use the `_fd` twins. `write_atomic_replace(&Path)` is public for the unconfined, absolute-path case. |
| `deploy/lock/{mod,unix,windows}.rs` | `lock::FileLock` | 1:1. |
| `store/local/owned_root.rs` | `root::OwnedRoot` + `EndpointKey` | Domain cut: the crate owns `EndpointKey`/`LOCAL_ENDPOINT_MARKER`. |
| `identity::*` (`id_newtype!`, `valid_name`, `valid_hex_digest`) | `id::*` | 1:1. The macro names `serde` through the crate, so the call site needs no `serde` dependency. |
| `remote/transport/rooted.rs` | `relpath::RootedRelativePath` | `from_validated` is **crate-private**; use the fallible `parse` at the boundary (a `LazyLock` for the static spellings). |
| `remote/transport/mod.rs`, `runner/**`, `ssh/**` | `transport::*` | `Layout` is a constructor argument; `LocalTransport::new(env, base, layout)`. `Remote::exists` is a default method; `metadata_opt` is the typed probe. |
| `remote/canonical/mod.rs` (tree half) | `manifest::*` | Pick by ROLE: `canonicalize_tree` for a source (strict), `canonicalize_tree_destination` for a destination (tolerant, `UnsupportedEntry { path, kind, reason }`). The `_checked` assemblers carry the completeness fact. **DONE**: `deploy`'s half is deleted and the substrate names re-exported; `deploy` has no tolerant destination path, so it uses the strict source walk for destinations and compares digests. |
| `remote/canonical/materialize.rs` | — | **STAYS in `deploy`.** It is the config-driven mapping/template materializer (`materialize_variant`, `TemplateVars`, `render_template`), not a tree-transfer protocol and not a plain mirror, so `sync` does not replace it. |
| *(new)* | `atomic::copy_dir_recursive_fd` + `fsync_tree_recursive_fd` | `deploy`'s shape: an arbitrary, possibly out-of-root `&Path` source into a root-confined `RootedRelativePath` staging destination, then canonicalize + digest + rename. |
| *(new)* | `atomic::copy_tree_verbatim(src, dst)` | The TOLERANT clone: copies a tree (reserved spellings, the `operation.lock` record, and crate-temp shapes included) between two ordinary absolute paths. Use it for `retention`'s clone of a live base; the destination is NOT a store root and must never be handed to the recovery sweep. |
| *(new)* | `transport::{with_operation_lock_sidecar, SIDECAR_WAIT_TIMEOUT, SIDECAR_RETRY_INTERVAL}` | The operation-scoped sidecar critical section (blocking-with-deadline, re-entrant, same record/inode as the far-side lock path). Replaces `deploy`'s own platform flock triple in `deploy/lock/{unix,windows}.rs` and its `remote::transport::{with_operation_lock_sidecar, wait_for_sidecar_flock, ensure_operation_lock_sidecar_durable}`. |
| *(new)* | `sync::sync(direction, .., ownership)` | One entry point. See the ownership note below. |
| `remote/helper/**` (push engine) | — | **Stays in `deploy`.** |
| `store/local/**`, `retention/**`, `kernel/**`, `ledger/**`, `verify/**`, `config/`, `init.rs` | — | **Stays in `deploy`.** |

## Ownership: the two design conflicts

- **(a) The sibling record vs `deploy`'s in-root lock — CLOSED.** The crate's
  plain `DestinationOwnership::lock` takes ONLY a sibling record
  (`<parent>/.<name>.operation.lock`), which does not exclude `deploy`'s in-root
  `state/operation.lock`. `DestinationOwnership::lock_with_in_root_lock(..,
  in_root_lock)` holds BOTH, in a fixed order (sibling first), with both
  acquisitions non-blocking so the order cannot deadlock. A `deploy` destination
  that has its own in-root record should take this form, and it must already
  exist (the composed form refuses a missing root without creating anything).
- **(b) A remote destination can now be locked — CLOSED.**
  `DestinationOwnership::lock_remote(direction, local_root, remote)` holds the
  destination's operation lock ON THE FAR SIDE for the whole run through a
  persistent far-side lock session (a long-lived `ssh` client whose remote
  `perl` takes a non-blocking `flock` on the SAME sibling record the local case
  uses). A `deploy` push into a remote destination should prefer this over
  `DestinationOwnership::Unowned`: it serialises concurrent cooperating runs and
  the record is released on every exit path. It is NOT a lease — a far-side lock
  cannot outlive its client — so `deploy`'s own far-side serialisation need not
  be DELETED for correctness while the run still depends on it; `lock_remote` is
  the crate-level exclusion, and `deploy`'s own protocol can be retired once the
  run no longer needs it. A NON-COOPERATING far-side writer is still outside the
  crate's exclusion. The pre-existing refusal is unchanged: `sync` still refuses
  a remote destination the caller does not own, and `Unowned` still names the
  weaker path.

## The one real data migration: the receiver marker

`deploy` stores `recv-<uuid-v7>` at `<deploy_dir>/receiver-uuid`. The crate
requires **40 lowercase hex** and fails closed on anything else, with no adoption
path — so without this step every existing deployment directory reads as
malformed, and the failure is silent to a test suite that builds fresh fixtures.

### Done (`deploy` `dev`, change `47e0e092`)

Adopt-on-read is implemented in `deploy` (`remote::transport::receiver_marker`):

- **Derivation.** `sha256("deploy/receiver-id/v1\0" || legacy)[..20]`, hex, where
  `legacy` is the canonical trimmed `recv-<uuid-v7>` string. Deterministic from
  the canonical string (file whitespace cannot change it), and domain-separated
  so it cannot collide with another hash of the same string. 160 bits, the same
  budget the crate's own receiver ids use.
- **Where.** The adopting read is `read_receiver_uuid_opt`; a read-only
  `peek_receiver_uuid_opt` is used when a preflight is a `--dry-run`, because
  adopt-on-read would otherwise MUTATE on a dry run. Fresh directories adopt on
  provision.
- **Wire form.** `<40 lowercase hex>\n` at `<deploy_dir>/receiver-id`, beside the
  legacy file. `receiver-uuid` is never opened for write and its bytes are
  unchanged; the module doc states the two conditions that would make it
  removable.
- **Fail closed.** An empty marker, `recv-`, a truncated uuid, or a 39/41-hex
  string is refused by `deploy`'s read AND by the crate, with no adoption.
- **Idempotent.** A second read leaves the inode, mtime and bytes identical.

The alternative (re-provisioning every directory) was not taken: it would discard
a stored identity for no benefit.

The crate will not adopt a foreign format silently, and should not: silently
adopting would misidentify a deployment directory.

## The `manifest`/`canonical` split (DONE)

`deploy/remote/canonical/mod.rs`'s tree half is the substrate's
`manifest::*`; `deploy`'s copy is deleted and the substrate names re-exported.
The swap replaces `deploy`'s LEXICAL, tree-ROOT-relative symlink containment
with the substrate's PHYSICAL walk from the link's containing directory: a
target that traverses a symlink component (intermediate or final) is now
refused, and a POSIX in-root target such as `dir/link -> ../other` is now
accepted (an over-refusal `deploy` could never have stored is lifted). Names
must already be NFC/UTF-8, targets must be UTF-8, the wire assembler takes the
walk's exit status (`canonicalize_remote_entries_checked`), splits on LF alone,
requires six fields and a parent-closed manifest, and enforces `NAME_MAX`. The
byte format is unchanged for a tree both walks accept, so no stored `tree.json`
or digest changes.

`deploy/remote/canonical/materialize.rs` STAYS. It is a mapping-set → staging
tree materializer (multiple sources placed into one content-addressed tree,
`{{var}}` rendering, per-mapping mode overrides, symlink/special sources
refused), not a plain mirror of one tree into another; the substrate's `sync`
engine cannot express its placement or rendering, so the answer to the step-4
question for this file is **do not adopt `sync`**.


- the crate's gate on BOTH platforms, plus `tests/consumer_fit.rs`, which fails
  to COMPILE if a consumer-required name is removed;
- `deploy`'s own test suite on the touched modules;
- for the marker step: a fixture directory carrying a legacy marker pushes
  successfully after adoption, and a corrupt marker still fails closed.

## Riskiest step

The receiver-marker migration — DONE (above). It was the only step that fails
closed against existing production state, and neither side's tests covered it
beforehand; the adoption test now fails on the pre-change tree and passes after.

## Out of scope

- the Windows runtime (`deploy`'s Windows port is type-checked only, and the
  crate's Windows test target compiles but has never executed).
